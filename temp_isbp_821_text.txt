         The International Standard Banking Practice (ISBP), first approved by the ICC
         Banking Commission in 2002 (Publication 645), updated in 2007 (Publication
         681), and again in 2013 (Publication 745), has developed into an invaluable aid to
         practitioners of documentary credits, on a global basis. ICC Banking Commission
         members and overall users of the rules have indicated the need for rules aligning
         with current trade finance practices and it would be appropriate to acknowledge
         that a major contributing factor has been the application of the practices detailed
         in the ISBP.                                      
         As announced at the Plenary Meeting in Paris on 20 October 2022, the Banking
         Commission SteerCo, in response to feedback from National Committees,
         established a Working Group in order to initiate a limited review of the ISBP 745.
         The aim was to evaluate all ICC Opinions approved since the release of the ISBP
         745 and to ensure that the ISBP were fully aligned with their content.
         It should be noted that the ISBP 745 were approved by ICC National Committees
         in 2013, and the reviewed Opinions were approved by ICC National Committees
         between October 2013 and January 2023.            
         Therefore, this review merely ensured alignment between previously approved
         texts, and allowed for all relevant material to be contained in a single publication.
         The outcome of the alignment review resulted in nine Opinions being recognised
         as containing content that would be meaningful for addition within the ISBP.
         These are now included in the ISBP 821 and comprise:
         ● New Preliminary Consideration viii) stating that the absence of a credit
          number, or the mistyping of a credit number, on a document is not a valid
          reason for refusal. (Opinion 876rev)             
         ● New Preliminary Consideration ix) providing that administrative conditions such
          as a requirement for an additional photocopy of all documents, or a statement
          that all documents may not be stapled, should not be incorporated by an
          issuing bank in a credit. (Opinion 915rev)       
         ● Add ‘Industries’ to paragraph A1 (Abbreviations). (Opinion 837rev)
         ● Add new paragraph A17 (b) (Documents and the need for completion of a box,
          field or space) stating that there is no requirement for the applicant name,
          address and contact details (if any) to appear in a specific box, field or space
          on an invoice. (Opinion 818rev)                  
         ● Add new paragraph A31 (b) (copy documents) stating that copies of
          documents need not be signed and move existing A31 (b) to A31 (c).
          (Opinion 842rev3)                                
         ● Add new paragraph C7 (general issues relating to invoices) providing that
          an invoice presented under a credit issued in USD, bearing only the “$” sign
          without further qualification, fulfils the requirement of UCP 600 sub-article 18

          (a) (iii) unless data in the invoice itself, or another presented document, implies
          that the “$” sign may refer to a currency other than USD. (Opinion 814rev4)
         ● Add new paragraphs D5 (e) (multimodal transport document), E5 (e) (bill of
          lading), & F4 (e) (non-negotiable sea waybill) stating that the signature of the
          master (captain) may be accompanied by a stamp that incorporates the name
          of the vessel. (Opinion 813)                     
         ● Add new paragraph G4 (c) (charter party bill of lading) stating that the
          signature of the master (captain) may be accompanied by a stamp that
          incorporates the name of the vessel. (Opinion 836rev)
         ● Add new paragraph K2 (b) stating that UCP 600 does not require that an
          agent or proxy is to be named in an insurance document and move existing
          paragraph K2 (b) to K2 (c). (Opinion 835rev)

         Preliminary considerations                        
                                                           
                                                           
                                                           
                                                           
         Scope of the publication                          
                                                           
      i) This publication is to be read in conjunction with UCP 600 and not in isolation.
      ii) The practices described in this publication highlight how the articles of UCP 600
         are to be interpreted and applied, to the extent that the terms and conditions
         of the credit, or any amendment thereto, do not expressly modify or exclude an
         applicable article in UCP 600.                    
         The credit and amendment application, the issuance
         of the credit and any amendment thereto           
      iii) The terms and conditions of a credit and any amendment thereto are
         independent of the underlying sale or other contract even if the credit or
         amendment expressly refers to that sale or other contract. When agreeing the
         terms of the sale or other contract, the parties thereto should be aware of the
         ensuing implications for the completion of the credit or amendment application.
      iv) Many of the problems that arise at the document examination stage could
         be avoided or resolved by the respective parties through careful attention to
         detail in the credit or amendment application and issuance of the credit or any
         amendment thereto. The applicant and beneficiary should carefully consider the
         documents required for presentation, by whom they are to be issued, their data
         content and the time frame in which they are to be presented.
      v) The applicant bears the risk of any ambiguity in its instructions to issue or amend
         a credit. An issuing bank may, unless the applicant expressly instructs to the
         contrary, supplement or develop those instructions in a manner necessary or
         desirable to permit the use of the credit or any amendment thereto. An issuing
         bank should ensure that any credit or amendment it issues is not ambiguous or
         conflicting in its terms and conditions.          
      vi) The applicant and issuing bank should be fully aware of the content of UCP 600
         and recognize that articles such as 3, 14, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 28 (i), 30 and 31 define
         terms in a manner that may produce unexpected results. For example, a credit
         requiring presentation of a bill of lading and containing a prohibition against
         transhipment will, in most cases, have to exclude UCP 600 sub-article 20 (c) to
         make the prohibition against transhipment effective.
      vii) A credit or any amendment thereto should not require presentation of a document
         that is to be issued, signed or countersigned by the applicant. If, nevertheless,
         a credit or amendment is issued including such a requirement, the beneficiary
         should consider the appropriateness of such a requirement and determine its
         ability to comply with it, or seek a suitable amendment.
      viii) A request to insert the credit number on a document is usually at the instigation
         of the issuing bank in order to facilitate the collation of documents should one
         or more documents become detached from the presentation. Provided all the
         stipulated documents are received by the issuing bank, the absence of a credit

         number or the mistyping of that number on a document does not constitute a
         reason for refusal. The exception to this position is where it is a requirement of the
         importing country that the credit number be stated on one or more documents. In
         such circumstances, the credit must clearly indicate that this is the reason for the
         number to be shown on that or those documents.    
      ix) An issuing bank should not incorporate in a credit administrative conditions such
         as a requirement for an additional set of copy documents to be presented for
         the issuing bank’s use, or a condition that all documents may not be stapled. If,
         nevertheless, such conditions are incorporated into a credit but not complied with,
         this will not constitute a reason for refusal.

         General principles                                
                                                           
                                                           
                                                           
                                                           
         Abbreviations                                     
                                                           
      A1) Generally accepted abbreviations, such as, but not limited to, “Int’l” instead of
         “International”, “Co.” instead of “Company”, “kgs” or “kos” instead of “kilograms”
         or “kilos”, “Ind.” instead of “Industry” or “Industries”, “Ltd” instead of “Limited”,
         “mfr” instead of “manufacturer” or “mt” instead of “metric tons” may be used
         in documents in substitution for a word or vice versa. A credit that includes an
         abbreviation in its text allows a document to show the same abbreviation or any
         other abbreviation that has the same meaning, or to show the complete spelling
         of the word or vice versa.                        
      A2) a. Virgules (i.e., slash marks “/”) may result in different meanings and should
           not be used as a substitute for a word. If, nevertheless, a virgule is used and
           no context is apparent, this will allow the use of one or more of the options.
           For example, a condition in a credit stating “Red/Black/Blue” with no further
           clarification will mean only Red or only Black or only Blue or any combination
           of them.                                        
         b. The use of a comma when indicating a range of data in a credit such as ports
           of loading or discharge or countries of origin, may result in different meanings
           and should not be used as a substitute for a word. If, nevertheless, a comma is
           used and no context is apparent, this will allow the use of one or more of the
           options. For example, when a credit allows partial shipment and indicates the
           port of loading information as “Hamburg, Rotterdam, Antwerp” with no further
           clarification, this will mean only Hamburg or only Rotterdam or only Antwerp
           or any combination of them.                     
         Certificates, certifications, declarations and statements
      A3) When a certificate, certification, declaration or statement is required by a credit, it
         is to be signed.                                  
      A4) Whether a certificate, certification, declaration or statement needs to be dated
         will depend on the type of certificate, certification, declaration or statement that
         has been requested, its required wording and the wording that appears within
         the document.                                     
         For example, when a credit requires the presentation of a certificate issued by
         the carrier or its agent stating that the vessel is no more than 25 years old, the
         certificate may evidence compliance by indicating:
         a. the date or year the vessel was built, and such date or year is no more than
           25 years prior to the date of shipment or the year in which shipment was
           effected, in which case a date of issuance is not necessary, or
         b. the wording as stated in the credit, in which case a date of issuance is
           required, thereby certifying that as of that date the vessel was not more than
           25 years old.

      A5) When a certification, declaration or statement is to appear in a document which
         is to be signed and dated, it does not require a separate signature or date when
         the certification, declaration or statement appears to have been given by the
         same entity that issued and signed the document.  
                                                           
         Copies of transport documents covered by UCP 600 articles 19-25
      A6) a. When a credit requires the presentation of a copy of a transport document
           covered by UCP 600 articles 19-25, the relevant article is not applicable,
           as these articles only apply to original transport documents. A copy of a
           transport document is to be examined only to the extent expressly stated in the
           credit, otherwise according to UCP 600 sub-article 14 (f).
         b. Any data shown on a copy of a transport document, when read in context with
           the credit, the document itself and international standard banking practice,
           need not be identical to, but must not conflict with, data in that document,
           any other stipulated document or the credit.    
         c. Copies of transport documents covered by UCP 600 articles 19-25 are not
           subject to the default presentation period of 21 calendar days stated in UCP
           600 sub-article 14 (c) or any presentation period stated in the credit, unless
           the credit explicitly states the basis for determining such presentation period.
           Otherwise, a presentation may be made at any time, but in any event no later
           than the expiry date of the credit.             
         Correction and alteration (“correction”)          
      A7) a. i. Any correction of data in a document issued by the beneficiary, with the
             exception of drafts (see paragraph B16)), need not be authenticated.
           ii. When a document issued by the beneficiary has been legalized, visaed,
             certified, etc., any correction of data is to be authenticated by at least
             one of the entities that legalized, visaed or certified, etc., the document.
             Such authentication is to indicate the name of the entity authenticating
             the correction either by use of a stamp incorporating its name, or by the
             addition of the name of the authenticating entity accompanied by its
             signature or initials.                        
         b. i. Any correction of data in a document, other than in a document issued
             by the beneficiary, is to appear to have been authenticated by the issuer
             or an entity acting as agent, proxy or for [or on behalf of] the issuer. Such
             authentication is to indicate the name of the entity authenticating the
             correction either by use of a stamp incorporating its name, or by the
             addition of the name of the authenticating entity accompanied by its
             signature or initials. In the case of authentication by an agent or proxy, the
             capacity of acting as agent or proxy for [or on behalf of] the issuer is to
             be stated.                                    
           ii. When a document other than one issued by the beneficiary has been
             legalized, visaed, certified, etc., any correction of data is, in addition to
             the requirements of paragraph A7) (b) (i), to be authenticated by at least
             one of the entities that legalized, visaed or certified, etc., the document.
             Such authentication is to indicate the name of the entity authenticating
             the correction either by use of a stamp incorporating its name, or by the
                                 International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) | 13
                                                           
                                                           
                                                           
      International Standard Banking Practice for the Examination of Documents under UCP 600
                                                           
             addition of the name of the authenticating entity accompanied by its
             signature or initials.                        
         c. Any correction of data in a copy document need not be authenticated.
                                                           
      A8) When a document other than one issued by the beneficiary contains more than
         one correction, either each correction is to be authenticated separately, or one
         authentication is to indicate that it applies to all the corrections. For example,
         when a document issued by XXX shows three corrections numbered 1, 2 and 3,
         one statement such as “Correction numbers 1, 2 and 3 authenticated by XXX” or
         similar, together with the signature or initials of XXX, will satisfy the requirement
         for authentication.                               
      A9) The use of multiple type styles, font sizes or handwriting within the same
         document does not, by itself, signify a correction.
         Courier receipt, post receipt and certificate of posting in respect
         of the sending of documents, notices and the like 
      A10) When a credit requires the presentation of a document as evidence of sending
         documents, notices and the like to a named or described entity, in the form of
         a courier receipt, post receipt or certificate of posting, such document is to be
         examined only to the extent expressly stated in the credit, otherwise according to
         UCP 600 sub-article 14 (f) and not under UCP 600 article 25.
         Dates                                             
      A11) a. Even when a credit does not expressly so require:
           i) drafts are to indicate a date of issuance;   
           ii) insurance documents are to indicate a date of issuance or effectiveness of
             the insurance coverage as reflected in paragraphs K10) (b) and K11); and
           iii) original transport documents, subject to examination under UCP 600
             articles 19-25, are to indicate a date of issuance, a dated on board
             notation, a date of shipment, a date of receipt for shipment, a date of
             dispatch or carriage, a date of taking in charge or a date of pick up or
             receipt, as applicable.                       
         b. A requirement that a document, other than a draft, insurance document or
           original transport document, be dated will be satisfied by the indication of
           a date of issuance or by reference in the document to the date of another
           document forming part of the same presentation (for example, by the wording
           “date as per bill of lading number xxx” appearing on a certificate issued by a
           carrier or its agent) or a date appearing on a stipulated document indicating
           the occurrence of an event (for example, by the date of inspection being
           indicated on an inspection certificate that otherwise does not contain a date
           of issuance).                                   
      A12) a. A document, such as, but not limited to, a certificate of analysis, inspection
           certificate or fumigation certificate, may indicate a date of issuance later
           than the date of shipment.                      
         b. When a credit requires a document to evidence a pre-shipment event (for
           example, “pre-shipment inspection certificate”), the document, either by its

           title, content or date of issuance, is to indicate that the event (for example,
           inspection) took place on or prior to the date of shipment.
         c. When a credit requires a document such as, but not limited to, an “inspection
           certificate”, this does not constitute a requirement that the document is to
           evidence a pre-shipment event, and it need not be dated prior to the date
           of shipment.                                    
      A13) A document indicating a date of issuance and a later date of signing is deemed to
         have been issued on the date of signing.          
      A14) a. When a credit uses phrases to signify time on either side of a date or an event,
           the following shall apply:                      
           i. “not later than 2 days after (date or event)” means a latest date. If an
             advice or document is not to be dated prior to a specified date or event,
             the credit should so state.                   
           ii. “at least 2 days before (date or event)” means that an act or event is to
             take place not later than 2 days before that date or event. There is no limit
             as to how early it may take place.            
         b. i. For the purpose of calculation of a period of time, the term “within” when
             used in connection with a date or event excludes that date or the event
             date in the calculation of the period. For example, “within 2 days of (date
             or event)” means a period of 5 days commencing 2 days prior to that date
             or event until 2 days after that date or event.
           ii. The term “within” when followed by a date or a reference to a
             determinable date or event includes that date or event date. For example,
             “presentation to be made within 14 May” or “presentation is to be made
             within credit validity (or credit expiry)” where the expiry date of the credit is
             14 May, means 14 May is the last day upon which presentation is allowed,
             provided that 14 May is a banking day.        
      A15) The words “from” and “after” when used to determine a maturity date or period
         for presentation following the date of shipment, the date of an event or the date
         of a document, exclude that date in the calculation of the period. For example, 10
         days after the date of shipment or 10 days from the date of shipment, where the
         date of shipment was 4 May, will be 14 May.       
      A16) Provided that the date intended can be determined from the document or from
         other documents included in the presentation, dates may be expressed in any
         format. For example, the 14th of May 2013 could be expressed as 14 May 13,
         14.05.2013, 14.05.13, 2013.05.14, 05.14.13, 130514, etc. To avoid any risk of ambiguity, it
         is recommended that the month be stated in words. 
         Documents and the need for completion of a box, field or space
      A17) a. The fact that a document has a box, field or space for data to be inserted
           does not necessarily mean that such box, field or space is to be completed.
           For example, data are not required in the box titled “Accounting Information”
           or “Handling Information” commonly found on an air waybill. Also see
           paragraph A37) in respect of the requirements for a signature to appear in any
           box, field or space.

         b. There is no requirement for the applicant name, address and contact details
           (if any) to appear in a specific box, field or space on an invoice. These details
           need not be identified by the heading or prefix ‘Applicant’.
                                                           
         Documents for which the UCP 600 transport articles do not apply
      A18) a. Documents commonly used in relation to the transportation of goods, such
           as but not limited to, Delivery Note, Delivery Order, Cargo Receipt, Forwarder’s
           Certificate of Receipt, Forwarder’s Certificate of Shipment, Forwarder’s
           Certificate of Transport, Forwarder’s Cargo Receipt and Mate’s Receipt are not
           transport documents as defined in UCP 600 articles 19-25. These documents
           are to be examined only to the extent expressly stated in the credit, otherwise
           according to UCP 600 sub-article 14 (f).        
         b. i. For documents referred to in paragraph A18) (a), a condition of a credit
             that presentation is to occur within a certain number of days after the
             date of shipment will be disregarded, and presentation may be made at
             any time, but in any event no later than the expiry date of the credit.
           ii. The default presentation period of 21 calendar days stated in UCP 600
             sub-article 14 (c) only applies to a presentation including one or more
             original transport documents covered by UCP 600 articles 19-25.
         c. For a presentation period to apply to a document referred to in paragraph
           A18) (a), the credit should specify that presentation is to be made within a
           certain number of days after the issuance date of the respective document,
           or a date that is to be mentioned in the document (for example, when a credit
           requires the presentation of a document titled cargo receipt, “documents to be
           presented no later than 10 days after the date of the cargo receipt”).
         Expressions not defined in UCP 600                
      A19) The expressions “shipping documents”, “stale documents acceptable”, “third party
         documents acceptable”, “third party documents not acceptable”, “exporting
         country”, “shipping company” and “documents acceptable as presented” should
         not be used in a credit, as they are not defined in UCP 600. If, nevertheless, they
         are used, and their meaning is not defined in the credit, they shall have the
         following meaning under international standard banking practice:
         a. “shipping documents” – all documents required by the credit, except drafts,
           teletransmission reports and courier receipts, postal receipts or certificates of
           posting evidencing the sending of documents.    
         b. “stale documents acceptable” – documents may be presented later than
           21 calendar days after the date of shipment as long as they are presented
           no later than the expiry date of the credit. This will also apply when the
           credit specifies a period for presentation together with the condition ”stale
           documents acceptable”.                          
         c. “third party documents acceptable” – all documents for which the credit or
           UCP 600 do not indicate an issuer, except drafts, may be issued by a named
           person or entity other than the beneficiary.    
         d. “third party documents not acceptable” – has no meaning and is to
           be disregarded.

         e. “exporting country” – one of the following: the country where the beneficiary
           is domiciled, the country of origin of the goods, the country of receipt by the
           carrier or the country from which shipment or dispatch is made.
         f. “shipping company” - when used in the context of the issuer of a certificate,
           certification or declaration relating to a transport document—any one of the
           following: carrier, master or, when a charter party bill of lading is presented,
           the master, owner or charterer, or any entity identified as an agent of any one
           of the aforementioned, regardless of whether it issued or signed the presented
           transport document.                             
         g. “documents acceptable as presented” – a presentation may consist of one
           or more of the stipulated documents provided they are presented within
           the expiry date of the credit and the drawing amount is within that which is
           available under the credit. The documents will not otherwise be examined
           for compliance under the credit or UCP 600, including whether they are
           presented in the required number of originals or copies.
         Issuer of documents                               
      A20) When a credit requires a document to be issued by a named person or entity, this
         condition is satisfied when the document appears to be issued by the named
         person or entity by use of its letterhead, or when there is no letterhead, when the
         document appears to have been completed or signed by, or for [or on behalf of],
         the named person or entity.                       
         Language                                          
      A21) a. When a credit stipulates the language of the documents to be presented, the
           data required by the credit or UCP 600 are to be in that language.
         b. When a credit is silent with respect to the language of the documents to be
           presented, the documents may be issued in any language.
         c. i. When a credit allows two or more acceptable languages, a confirming
             bank or a nominated bank acting on its nomination may restrict the
             number of acceptable languages as a condition of its engagement in the
             credit, and in such a case the data contained in the documents are only to
             be in the acceptable language or languages.   
           ii. When a credit allows a document to contain data in two or more
             acceptable languages and a confirming bank or a nominated bank
             acting on its nomination does not restrict the language or the number of
             acceptable languages as a condition of its engagement in the credit, it is
             required to examine the data in all of the acceptable languages appearing
             in the documents.                             
         d. Banks do not examine data that have been inserted in a language that is
           additional to that required or allowed in the credit.
         e. Notwithstanding paragraphs A21) (a) and (d), the name of a person or entity,
           any stamps, legalization, endorsements or similar, and the pre-printed text
           shown on a document, such as, but not limited to, field headings, may be in a
           language other than that required in the credit.

         Mathematical calculations                         
                                                           
      A22) When the presented documents indicate mathematical calculations, banks only
         determine that the stated total in respect of criteria such as amount, quantity,
         weight or number of packages, does not conflict with the credit or any other
         stipulated document.                              
         Misspellings or typing errors                     
      A23) A misspelling or typing error that does not affect the meaning of a word or the
         sentence in which it occurs does not make a document discrepant. For example, a
         description of the goods shown as “mashine” instead of “machine”, “fountan pen”
         instead of “fountain pen” or “modle” instead of “model” would not be regarded as
         a conflict of data under UCP 600 sub-article 14 (d). However, a description shown
         as, for example, “model 123” instead of “model 321” will be regarded as a conflict
         of data under that sub-article.                   
         Multiple pages and attachments or riders          
      A24) When a document consists of more than one page, it must be possible to
         determine that the pages are part of the same document. Unless a document
         provides otherwise, pages which are physically bound together, sequentially
         numbered or contain internal cross references, however named or titled, will meet
         this requirement and are to be examined as one document, even if some of the
         pages are regarded as an attachment or rider.     
      A25) When a signature or endorsement is required to be on a document consisting
         of more than one page, and the credit or the document itself does not indicate
         where a signature or endorsement is to appear, the signature or endorsement
         may appear anywhere on that document.             
         Non-documentary conditions and conflict of data   
      A26) When a credit contains a condition without stipulating a document to indicate
         compliance therewith (“non-documentary condition”), compliance with such
         condition need not be evidenced on any stipulated document. However, data
         contained in a stipulated document are not to be in conflict with the non-
         documentary condition. For example, when a credit indicates “packing in wooden
         cases” without indicating that such data is to appear on any stipulated document,
         a statement in any stipulated document indicating a different type of packing is
         considered to be a conflict of data.              
         Originals and copies                              
      A27) A document bearing an apparently original signature, mark, stamp or label of the
         issuer will be considered to be an original unless it states that it is a copy. Banks
         do not determine whether such a signature, mark, stamp or label of the issuer has
         been applied in a manual or facsimile form and, as such, any document bearing
         such method of authentication will satisfy the requirements of UCP 600 article 17.
      A28) Documents issued in more than one original may be marked “Original”,
         “Duplicate”, “Triplicate”, “First Original”, “Second Original”, etc. None of these
         markings will disqualify a document as an original.

      A29) a. The number of originals to be presented is to be at least the number required
           by the credit or UCP 600.                       
         b. When a transport document or insurance document indicates how many
           originals have been issued, the number of originals stated on the document is
           to be presented, except as stated in paragraphs H12) and J7) (c).
         c. When a credit requires presentation of less than a full set of original
           transport documents, (for example, “2/3 original bills of lading”), but does not
           provide any disposal instructions for the remaining original bill of lading, a
           presentation may include 3/3 original bills of lading.
         d. When a credit requires, for example, presentation of:
           i. “Invoice”, “One Invoice”, “Invoice in 1 copy” or “Invoice—1 copy”, it will be
             understood to be a requirement for an original invoice.
           ii. “Invoice in 4 copies” or “Invoice in 4 fold” will be satisfied by the
             presentation of at least one original invoice and any remaining number as
             copies.                                       
           iii. “photocopy of invoice” or “copy of invoice” will be satisfied by the
             presentation of either a photocopy, copy or, when not prohibited, an
             original invoice.                             
           iv. “photocopy of a signed invoice” will be satisfied by the presentation of
             either a photocopy or copy of the original invoice that was apparently
             signed or, when not prohibited, a signed original invoice.
      A30) a. When a credit prohibits the presentation of an original document by stating,
           for example, “photocopy of invoice—original document not acceptable in lieu
           of photocopy” or the like, only a photocopy of an invoice or an invoice marked
           copy is to be presented.                        
         b. When a credit requires the presentation of a copy of a transport document
           and indicates a disposal instruction for all originals of that document, a
           presentation is not to include any original of such document.
      A31) a. Original documents are to be signed when required by the credit, the
           document itself (except as stated in paragraph A37)) or UCP 600.
         b. Copies of document need not be signed, even when a credit states that all
           documents are to be manually signed.            
         c. Copies of documents need not be dated.         
         Shipping marks                                    
      A32) When a credit specifies the details of a shipping mark, documents mentioning the
         shipping mark are to show those details. The data in a shipping mark indicated on
         a document need not be in the same sequence as those shown in the credit or in
         any other stipulated document.                    
      A33 A shipping mark indicated on a document may show data in excess of what
         would normally be considered a “shipping mark”, or which is specified in the credit
         as a “shipping mark”, by the addition of information such as, but not limited to, the
         type of goods, warnings concerning the handling of fragile goods or net and gross
         weight of the goods.

      A34) a. Transport documents covering containerized goods often only show a
           container number, with or without a seal number, under the heading “Shipping
           mark” or similar. Other documents that show a more detailed marking will not
           be in conflict for that reason.                 
         b. The fact that some documents show additional information as mentioned in
           paragraphs A33) and A34) (a), while others do not, will not be regarded as a
           conflict of data under UCP 600 sub-article 14 (d).
         Signatures                                        
                                                           
      A35) a. A signature, as referred to in paragraph A31) (a), need not be handwritten.
           Documents may also be signed with a facsimile signature (for example, a
           pre-printed or scanned signature), perforated signature, stamp, symbol (for
           example, a chop) or any mechanical or electronic method of authentication.
         b. A requirement for a document to be “signed and stamped” or a similar
           requirement is satisfied by a signature in the form described in paragraph
           A35) (a) and the name of the signing entity typed, stamped, handwritten, pre-
           printed or scanned on the document, etc.        
         c. A statement on a document such as “This document has been electronically
           authenticated” or “This document has been produced by electronic means
           and requires no signature” or words of similar effect does not, by itself,
           represent an electronic method of authentication in accordance with the
           signature requirements of UCP 600 article 3.    
         d. A statement on a document indicating that authentication may be verified or
           obtained through a specific reference to a website (URL) constitutes a form
           of electronic method of authentication in accordance with the signature
           requirements of UCP 600 article 3. Banks will not access such websites to
           verify or obtain authentication.                
      A36) a. A signature on the letterhead paper of a named person or entity is considered
           to be the signature of that named person or entity unless otherwise stated.
           The named person or entity need not be repeated next to the signature.
         b. When a signatory indicates it is signing for [or on behalf of] a branch of the
           issuer, the signature will be considered to be that of the issuer.
      A37) The fact that a document has a box, field or space for a signature does not in
         itself mean that such box, field or space is to be completed with a signature. For
         example, a signature is not required in the space titled “Signature of shipper or
         their agent” commonly found on an air waybill or “Signature of shipper” on a road
         transport document. Also see paragraph A17) in respect of the requirements for
         data to appear in a box, field or space.          
      A38) When a document includes wording such as “This document is not valid unless
         countersigned [or signed] by (name of the person or entity)” or words of similar
         effect, the applicable box, field or space is to contain a signature and the name of
         the person or entity that is countersigning the document.

      A39) Documents may be titled as called for in the credit, bear a similar title or be
         untitled. The content of a document must appear to fulfil the function of the
         required document. For example, a requirement for a “Packing List” will be satisfied
         by a document containing packing details whether it is titled “Packing List”,
         “Packing Note”, “Packing and Weight List”, etc., or bears no title.
      A40) Documents required by a credit are to be presented as separate documents.
         However, and as an example, a requirement for an original packing list and
         an original weight list will also be satisfied by the presentation of two original
         combined packing and weight lists, provided that such documents state both
         packing and weight details.                       
      A41) A document required by a credit that is to cover more than one function may be
         presented as a single document or separate documents that appear to fulfil each
         function. For example, a requirement for a Certificate of Quality and Quantity will
         be satisfied by the presentation of a single document or by a separate Certificate
         of Quality and Certificate of Quantity provided that each document appears

      B1) a. A draft, when required, is to be drawn on the bank stated in the credit.
         b. Banks only examine a draft to the extent described in paragraphs B2)-B17).
         Tenor                                             
      B2) a. The tenor stated on a draft is to be in accordance with the terms of the credit.
         b. When a credit requires a draft to be drawn at a tenor other than sight or a
           certain period after sight, it must be possible to establish the maturity date
           from the data in the draft itself.              
           For example, when a credit calls for drafts at a tenor 60 days after the bill of lading
           date, and when the date of the bill of lading is 14 May 2013, the tenor is to be indicated
           on the draft in one of the following ways:      
           i. “60 days after bill of lading date 14 May 2013”, or
           ii. “60 days after 14 May 2013”, or             
           iii. “60 days after bill of lading date” and elsewhere on the face of the draft
             state “bill of lading date 14 May 2013”, or   
           iv. “60 days date” on a draft dated the same day as the date of the bill of
             lading, or                                    
           v. “13 July 2013”, i.e., 60 days after the bill of lading date.
         c. When the tenor refers to, for example, 60 days after the bill of lading date, the
           on board date is deemed to be the bill of lading date even when the on board
           date is prior to or later than the date of issuance of the bill of lading.
         d. The words “from” and “after” when used to determine maturity dates of drafts
           signify that the calculation of the maturity date commences the day following
           the date of the document, shipment or the date of an event stipulated in the
           credit, for example, 10 days after or from 4 May is 14 May.
         e. i. When a credit requires a bill of lading and drafts are to be drawn, for
             example, at 60 days after or from the bill of lading date and a bill of lading
             is presented evidencing unloading and reloading of the goods from one
             vessel to another, and showing more than one dated on board notation
             and indicating that each shipment was effected from a port within a
             permitted geographical area or range of ports, the earliest of these dates
             is to be used for the calculation of the maturity date. For example, a credit
             requires shipment from any European port, and the bill of lading evidences
             on board vessel “A” from Dublin on 14 May, with transhipment effected on
             board vessel “B” from Rotterdam on 16 May. The draft should reflect 60
             days after the earliest on board date in a European port, i.e., 14 May.
           ii. When a credit requires a bill of lading and drafts are to be drawn, for
             example, at 60 days after or from the bill of lading date, and a bill of lading
             is presented evidencing shipment of goods on the same vessel from more

             than one port within a permitted geographical area or range of ports, and
             shows more than one dated on board notation, the latest of these dates
             is to be used for the calculation of the maturity date. For example, a credit
             requires shipment from any European port, and the bill of lading evidences
             part of the goods loaded on board vessel “A” from Dublin on 14 May and
             the remainder on board the same vessel from Rotterdam on 16 May. The
             draft should reflect 60 days after the latest on board date, i.e., 16 May.
           iii. When a credit requires a bill of lading and drafts are to be drawn, for
             example, at 60 days after or from the bill of lading date, and more than
             one set of bills of lading is presented under one draft, the on board date of
             the latest bill of lading will be used for the calculation of the maturity date.
      B3) While the examples in paragraphs B2) (e) (i-iii) refer to bill of lading dates, the
         same principles apply to any basis for determining a maturity date.
         Maturity date                                     
      B4) When a draft states a maturity date by using an actual date, that date is to reflect
         the terms of the credit.                          
      B5) For drafts drawn, for example, “at 60 days sight”, the maturity date is established
         as follows:                                       
         a. in the case of a complying presentation, the maturity date will be 60 days
           after the day of presentation to the bank on which the draft is drawn, i.e., the
           issuing bank, confirming bank or a nominated bank that agrees to act on its
           nomination (“drawee bank”).                     
         b. in the case of a non-complying presentation:   
           i. when such drawee bank has not provided a notice of refusal, the maturity
             date will be 60 days after the day of presentation to it;
           ii. when the drawee bank is the issuing bank and it has provided a notice of
             refusal at the latest 60 days after the date the issuing bank accepts the
             waiver of the applicant;                      
           iii. when the drawee bank is a bank other than the issuing bank and it has
             provided a notice of refusal, at the latest 60 days after the date of the
             acceptance advice of the issuing bank. When such drawee bank does
             not agree to act on the acceptance advice of the issuing bank, the
             undertaking to honour on the due date is that of the issuing bank.
         c. The drawee bank is to advise or confirm the maturity date to the presenter.
      B6) The method of calculation of tenor and maturity dates, as shown above, also
         applies to a credit available by deferred payment or, in some cases, negotiation,
         i.e., when there is no requirement for a draft to be presented by the beneficiary.

      B7) Payment is to be made in immediately available funds on the due date at the
         place where the draft or documents are payable, provided that such due date is
         a banking day in that place. When the due date is a non-banking day, payment
         is due on the first banking day following the due date. Delays in the remittance of
         funds, for example grace days, the time it takes to remit funds, etc., are not to be
         in addition to the stated or agreed due date as defined by the draft or documents.
         Drawing and signing                               
      B8) a. A draft is to be drawn and signed by the beneficiary and to indicate a date of
           issuance.                                       
         b. When the beneficiary or second beneficiary has changed its name, and
           the credit mentions the former name, a draft may be drawn in the name of
           the new entity provided that it indicates “formerly known as (name of the
           beneficiary or second beneficiary)” or words of similar effect.
      B9) When a credit indicates the drawee of a draft by only stating the SWIFT address
         of a bank, the draft may show the drawee with the same details or the full name
         of the bank.                                      
      B10) When a credit is available by negotiation with a nominated bank or any bank, the
         draft is to be drawn on a bank other than the nominated bank.
      B11) When a credit is available by acceptance with any bank, the draft is to be drawn
         on the bank that agrees to accept the draft and is thereby willing to act on its
         nomination.                                       
      B12) When a credit is available by acceptance with:  
         a. a nominated bank or any bank, and the draft is to be drawn on that
           nominated bank (which is not a confirming bank), and it decides not to act on
           its nomination, the beneficiary may choose to:  
           i. draw the draft on the confirming bank, if any, or request that the
             presentation be forwarded to the confirming bank in the form as
             presented;                                    
           ii. present the documents to another bank that agrees to accept a draft
             drawn on it and thereby act on its nomination (applicable only when the
             credit is available with any bank); or        
           iii. request that the presentation be forwarded to the issuing bank in the form
             as presented with or without a draft drawn on the issuing bank.
         b. a confirming bank, and the draft is to be drawn on that confirming bank
           and the presentation is non-complying, and it decides not to reinstate its
           confirmation, the beneficiary may request that the presentation be forwarded
           to the issuing bank in the form as presented, with or without a draft drawn on
           the issuing bank.

      B14) The amount in words is to accurately reflect the amount in figures when both are
         shown, and indicate the currency as stated in the credit. When the amount in
         words and figures are in conflict, the amount in words is to be examined as the

         Correction and alteration (“correction”)          
      B16) Any correction of data on a draft is to appear to have been authenticated with
         the addition of the signature or initials of the beneficiary.
      B17) When no correction of data is allowed in a draft, an issuing bank should have
         included a suitable stipulation in its credit.    
         Drafts drawn on the applicant                     
                                                           
      B18) a. A credit must not be issued available by a draft drawn on the applicant.
         b. However, when a credit requires the presentation of a draft drawn on the
           applicant as one of the required documents, it is to be examined only to the
           extent expressly stated in the credit, otherwise according to UCP 600 sub-
           article 14 (f).

         Invoices                                          
                                                           
                                                           
                                                           
                                                           
         Title of invoice                                  
                                                           
      C1) a. When a credit requires presentation of an “invoice” without further description,
           this will be satisfied by the presentation of any type of invoice (commercial
           invoice, customs invoice, tax invoice, final invoice, consular invoice, etc.).
           However, an invoice is not to be identified as “provisional”, “pro-forma” or the
           like.                                           
         b. When a credit requires presentation of a “commercial invoice”, this will also be
           satisfied by the presentation of a document titled “invoice”, even when such
           document contains a statement that it has been issued for tax purposes.
         Issuer of an invoice                              
      C2) a. An invoice is to appear to have been issued by the beneficiary or, in the case
           of a transferred credit, the second beneficiary.
         b. When the beneficiary or second beneficiary has changed its name and the
           credit mentions the former name, an invoice may be issued in the name of
           the new entity provided that it indicates “formerly known as (name of the
           beneficiary or second beneficiary)” or words of similar effect.
         Description of the goods, services or performance and other
         general issues related to invoices                
      C3) The description of the goods, services or performance shown on the invoice is to
         correspond with the description shown in the credit. There is no requirement for
         a mirror image. For example, details of the goods may be stated in a number of
         areas within the invoice which, when read together, represent a description of the
         goods corresponding to that in the credit.        
      C4) The description of goods, services or performance on an invoice is to reflect what
         has actually been shipped, delivered or provided. For example, when the goods
         description in the credit indicates a requirement for shipment of “10 trucks and 5
         tractors”, and only 4 trucks have been shipped, an invoice may indicate shipment
         of only 4 trucks provided that the credit did not prohibit partial shipment. An
         invoice indicating what has actually been shipped (4 trucks) may also contain the
         description of the goods stated in the credit, i.e., 10 trucks and 5 tractors.
      C5) An invoice showing a description of the goods, services or performance that
         corresponds with that in the credit may also indicate additional data in respect of
         the goods, services or performance provided that they do not appear to refer to a
         different nature, classification or category of the goods, services or performance.
         For example, when a credit requires shipment of “Suede Shoes”, but the invoice
         describes the goods as “Imitation Suede Shoes”, or when the credit requires
         “Hydraulic Drilling Rig”, but the invoice describes the goods as “Second Hand
         Hydraulic Drilling Rig”, these descriptions would represent a change in nature,
         classification or category of the goods.

      C6) An invoice is to indicate:                       
         a. the value of the goods shipped or delivered, or services or performance
           provided.                                       
         b. unit price(s), when stated in the credit.      
                                                           
         c. the same currency as that shown in the credit. 
         d. any discount or deduction required by the credit.
      C7) When a credit is issued in USD, and the invoice currency is shown as a “$” sign,
         without further qualification, the invoice will fulfil the requirement of UCP 600 sub-
         article 18 (a) (iii) of being made out in the same currency as the credit, unless data
         in the invoice itself, such as the domicile of the beneficiary is in a country whose
         currency is denominated in dollars and/or is commonly referred to with a “$” sign,
         or another presented document implies that the “$” sign may refer to a currency
         other than USD.                                   
      C8) An invoice may indicate a deduction covering advance payment, discount, etc.,
         that is not stated in the credit.                 
      C9) When a trade term is stated as part of the goods description in the credit, an
         invoice is to indicate that trade term, and when the source of the trade term is
         stated, the same source is to be indicated. For example, a trade term indicated
         in a credit as “CIF Singapore Incoterms 2010” is not to be indicated on an invoice
         as “CIF Singapore” or “CIF Singapore Incoterms”. However, when a trade term is
         stated in the credit as “CIF Singapore” or “CIF Singapore Incoterms”, it may also be
         indicated on an invoice as “CIF Singapore Incoterms 2010” or any other revision.
      C10) Additional charges and costs, such as those related to documentation, freight
         or insurance costs, are to be included within the value shown against the stated
         trade term on the invoice.                        
      C11) An invoice need not be signed or dated.         
      C12) Any total quantity of goods and their weight or measurement shown on the
         invoice is not to conflict with the same data appearing on other documents.
      C13) An invoice is not to indicate:                  
         a. over-shipment (except as provided in UCP 600 sub-article 30 (b)), or
         b. goods, services or performance not called for in the credit. This applies
           even when the invoice includes additional quantities of goods, services or
           performance as required by the credit or samples and advertising material
           and are stated to be free of charge.            
      C14) The quantity of goods required in the credit may be indicated on an invoice within
         a tolerance of +/-5%. A variance of up to +5% in the quantity of the goods does not
         allow the amount demanded under the presentation to exceed the amount of the
         credit. The tolerance of +/-5% in the quantity of the goods will not apply when:
         a. a credit states that the quantity is not to be exceeded or reduced; or
         b. a credit states the quantity in terms of a stipulated number of packing units or
           individual items.                               
      C15) When no quantity of goods is stated in the credit, and partial shipments are
         prohibited, an invoice issued for an amount up to 5% less than the credit amount
         will be considered to cover the full quantity and not a partial shipment.

      C16) a. i. When a drawing or shipment by instalments within given periods is
             stipulated in the credit, and any instalment is not drawn or shipped within
             the period allowed for that instalment, the credit ceases to be available
             for that and any subsequent instalment. Given periods are a sequence of
             dates or timelines that determine a start and end date for each instalment.
             For example, a credit requiring shipment of 100 cars in March and 100 cars
             in April is an example of two periods of time that start on 1 March and 1
             April and end on 31 March and 30 April respectively.
           ii. When partial drawings or shipments are allowed, any number of drawings
             or shipments is permitted within each instalment.
         b. When a credit indicates a drawing or shipment schedule by only indicating
           a number of latest dates, and not given periods (as referred to in paragraph
           C15) (a) (i):                                   
           i. this is not an instalment schedule as envisaged by UCP 600, and article
             32 will not apply. The presentation is to otherwise comply with any
             instructions in respect of the drawing or shipment schedule and UCP 600
             article 31;                                   
           ii. when partial drawings or shipments are allowed, any number of drawings

         Application of UCP 600 Article 19                 
      D1) a. A requirement in a credit for the presentation of a transport document,
           however named, covering movement of goods utilizing at least two different
           modes of transport means that UCP 600 article 19 is to be applied in the
           examination of that document.                   
         b. i. A multimodal or combined transport document is not to indicate that
             shipment or dispatch has been effected by only one mode of transport,
             but it may be silent regarding some or all of the modes of transport
             utilized.                                     
           ii. A multimodal or combined transport document is not to contain any
             indication of a charter party as described in paragraphs G2) (a) and (b).
         c. When a credit requires the presentation of a transport document other than a
           multimodal or combined transport document, and it is clear from the routing
           of the goods stated in the credit that more than one mode of transport is to
           be utilized, for example, when an inland place of receipt or final destination
           are indicated, or the port of loading or discharge field is completed but with a
           place which is in fact an inland place and not a port, UCP 600 article 19 is to
           be applied in the examination of that document. 
      D2) In all places where the term “multimodal transport document” is used within
         this publication, it also includes the term “combined transport document”.
         The transport document presented need not be titled “Multimodal transport
         document” or “Combined transport document” or words of similar effect even
         when the credit so names the required document.   
         Issuance, carrier, identification of the carrier and signing
         of a multimodal transport document                
      D3) a. A multimodal transport document may be issued by any entity other than a
           carrier or master (captain) provided it meets the requirements of UCP 600
           article 19.                                     
         b. When a credit indicates “Freight Forwarder’s Multimodal Transport Document
           is acceptable” or “House Multimodal Transport Document is acceptable” or
           words of similar effect, a multimodal transport document may be signed by
           the issuing entity without it being necessary to indicate the capacity in which
           it has been signed or the name of the carrier.  
      D4) A stipulation in a credit that “Freight Forwarder’s Multimodal Transport Documents
         are not acceptable” or “House Multimodal Transport Documents are not
         acceptable” or words of similar effect has no meaning in the context of the
                                 International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) | 29

         title, format, content or signing of a multimodal transport document unless the
         credit provides specific requirements detailing how the multimodal transport
         document is to be issued and signed. In the absence of these requirements,
         such a stipulation is to be disregarded, and the multimodal transport document
         presented is to be examined according to the requirements of UCP 600 article 19.
      D5) a. A multimodal transport document is to be signed in the form described in UCP
           600 sub-article 19 (a) (i) and to indicate the name of the carrier, identified as
           the carrier.                                    
         b. When a multimodal transport document is signed by a named branch of the
           carrier, the signature is considered to have been made by the carrier.
         c. When an agent signs a multimodal transport document for [or on behalf of]
           the carrier, the agent is to be named and, in addition, to indicate that it is
           signing as “agent for (name), the carrier” or as “agent on behalf of (name),
           the carrier” or words of similar effect. When the carrier is identified elsewhere
           in the document as the “carrier”, the named agent may sign, for example, as
           “agent for [or on behalf of] the carrier” without naming the carrier again.
         d. When the master (captain) signs a multimodal transport document, the
           signature of the master (captain) is to be identified as the “master” (“captain”).
           The name of the master (captain) need not be stated.
         e. When the master (captain) signs a multimodal transport document, the
           signature may be accompanied by a stamp that incorporates the name of the
           vessel. Even if the stamp also mentions the name of the owner, the multimodal
           transport document will be considered to have been signed by the master
           (captain). This stamp is often referred to as the ‘ship’s stamp’.
         f. When an agent signs a multimodal transport document for [or on behalf of]
           the master (captain), the agent is to be named and, in addition, to indicate
           that it is signing as “agent for the master (or captain)” or as “agent on behalf
           of the master (or captain)” or words of similar effect. The name of the master
           (captain) need not be stated.                   
         On board notation, date of shipment, place of receipt, dispatch,
         taking in charge, port of loading or airport of departure
      D6) The issuance date of a multimodal transport document will be deemed to be the
         date of receipt, dispatch, taking in charge or shipment on board and the date of
         shipment, unless it bears a separate dated notation evidencing receipt, dispatch,
         taking in charge or shipment on board from the place, port or airport stated in the
         credit. In the latter event, such date will be deemed to be the date of shipment
         whether that date is before or after the issuance date of the multimodal transport
         document. A separate dated notation may also be indicated in a designated field
         or box.                                           
      D7) When a credit requires shipment to commence from a port, i.e., when the first
         leg of the journey, as required by the credit, is by sea, a multimodal transport
         document is to indicate a dated on board notation, and in this event paragraph
         E6) (b-d) will also apply.                        
      D8) In a multimodal transport document, when a credit requires shipment to
         commence from a port, the named port of loading should appear in the port of
         loading field. However, it may also be stated in the field headed “Place of receipt”

         or words of similar effect, provided there is a dated on board notation evidencing
         that the goods were shipped on board a named vessel at the port stated under
         “Place of receipt” or words of similar effect.    
      D9) A multimodal transport document is to indicate the place of receipt, dispatch,
         taking in charge, port of loading or airport of departure stated in the credit. When
         a credit indicates the place of receipt, dispatch, taking in charge, port of loading
         or airport of departure by also stating the country in which the place, port or
         airport is located, the name of the country need not be stated.
      D10) When a credit indicates a geographical area or range of places of receipt,
         dispatch, taking in charge, ports of loading or airports of departure (for example,
         “Any European Country” or “Hamburg, Rotterdam, Antwerp Port”), a multimodal
         transport document is to indicate the actual place of receipt, dispatch, taking
         in charge, port of loading or airport of departure, which is to be within that
         geographical area or range of places. A multimodal transport document need not
         indicate the geographical area.                   
      D11) Terms such as “Shipped in apparent good order”, “Laden on board”, “Clean on
         board” or other phrases that incorporate “shipped” or “on board” have the same
         effect as the words “Shipped on board”.           
         Place of final destination, port of discharge or airport
         of destination                                    
      D12) a. In a multimodal transport document, when a credit requires shipment to be
           effected to a port, the named port of discharge should appear in the port of
           discharge field.                                
         b. However, the named port of discharge may be stated in the field headed
           “Place of final destination” or words of similar effect provided there is a
           notation evidencing that the port of discharge is that stated under “Place of
           final destination” or words of similar effect. For example, when a credit requires
           shipment to be effected to Felixstowe, but Felixstowe is shown as the place of
           final destination instead of the port of discharge, this may be evidenced by a
           notation stating “Port of discharge Felixstowe”.
      D13) A multimodal transport document is to indicate the place of final destination, port
         of discharge or airport of destination stated in the credit. When a credit indicates
         the place of final destination port of discharge or airport of destination by also
         stating the country in which the place or port is located, the name of the country
         need not be stated.                               
      D14) When a credit indicates a geographical area or range of places of final
         destination, ports of discharge or airports of destination (for example, “Any
         European Country” or “Hamburg, Rotterdam, Antwerp Port”), a multimodal
         transport document is to indicate the actual place of final destination, port of
         discharge or airport of destination, which is to be within that geographical area
         or range of places. A multimodal transport document need not indicate the
         geographical area.                                
         Original multimodal transport document            
      D15) a. A multimodal transport document is to indicate the number of originals that
           have been issued.

         b. Multimodal transport documents marked “First Original”, “Second Original”,
           “Third Original”, or “Original”, “Duplicate”, “Triplicate” or similar expressions are
           all originals.                                  
                                                           
         Consignee, order party, shipper and endorsement, and notify
         party                                             
      D16) When a credit requires a multimodal transport document to evidence that goods
         are consigned to a named entity, for example, “consigned to (named entity)”
         (i.e., a “straight” multimodal transport document or consignment) rather than “to
         order” or “to order of (named entity)”, it is not to contain the expressions “to order”
         or “to order of” preceding the named entity, or the expression “or order” following
         the named entity, whether typed or pre-printed.   
      D17) a. When a multimodal transport document is issued “to order” or “to order of the
           shipper”, it is to be endorsed by the shipper. An endorsement may be made by
           a named entity other than the shipper, provided the endorsement is made for
           [or on behalf of] the shipper.                  
         b. When a credit requires a multimodal transport document to evidence that
           goods are consigned “to order of (named entity)”, it is not to indicate that the
           goods are straight consigned to that named entity.
      D18) a. When a credit stipulates the details of one or more notify parties, a multimodal
           transport document may also indicate the details of one or more additional
           notify parties.                                 
         b. i. When a credit does not stipulate the details of a notify party, a multimodal
             transport document may indicate the details of any notify party and in any
             manner (except as stated in paragraph D18) (b) (ii)).
           ii. When a credit does not stipulate the details of a notify party, but the
             details of the applicant appear as notify party on a multimodal transport
             document, and these details include the applicant’s address and contact
             details, they are not to conflict with those stated in the credit.
      D19) When a credit requires a multimodal transport document to evidence goods
         consigned to or to the order of “issuing bank” or “applicant” or notify “applicant”
         or “issuing bank”, a multimodal transport document is to indicate the name of the
         issuing bank or applicant, as applicable, but need not indicate their respective
         addresses or any contact details that may be stated in the credit.
      D20) When the address and contact details of the applicant appear as part of the
         consignee or notify party details, they are not to conflict with those stated in
         the credit.                                       
         Transhipment, partial shipment and determining the presentation
         period when multiple sets of multimodal transport documents are
         presented                                         
      D21) In multimodal transport transhipment will occur. Transhipment is the unloading
         and reloading of goods from one means of conveyance to another means of
         conveyance (whether or not in different modes of transport) during the carriage
         of those goods from the place of receipt, dispatch or taking in charge, port of
         loading or airport of departure to the place of final destination, port of discharge
         or airport of destination stated in the credit.

      D22) Shipment on more than one means of conveyance (more than one truck [lorry],
         vessel, aircraft, etc.) is a partial shipment, even when such means of conveyance
         leaves on the same day for the same destination.  
      D23) a. When a credit prohibits partial shipment, and more than one set of original
           multimodal transport documents are presented covering receipt, dispatch,
           taking in charge or shipment from one or more points of origin (as specifically
           allowed, or within a geographical area or range of places stated in the credit),
           each set is to indicate that it covers the carriage of goods on the same means
           of conveyance and same journey and that the goods are destined for the
           same destination.                               
         b. When a credit prohibits partial shipment, and more than one set of original
           multimodal transport documents are presented in accordance with paragraph
           D23) (a) and incorporate different dates of receipt, dispatch, taking in charge,
           or shipment, the latest of these dates is to be used for the calculation of
           any presentation period and must fall on or before the latest date of receipt,
           dispatch, taking in charge or shipment stated in the credit.
         c. When partial shipment is allowed, and more than one set of original
           multimodal transport documents are presented as part of a single
           presentation made under one covering schedule or letter and incorporate
           different dates of receipt, dispatch, taking in charge or shipment, on different
           means of conveyance, the earliest of these dates is to be used for the
           calculation of any presentation period, and each of these dates must fall on or
           before the latest date of receipt, dispatch, taking in charge or shipment stated
           in the credit.                                  
         Clean multimodal transport document               
      D24) A multimodal transport document is not to include a clause or clauses that
         expressly declare a defective condition of the goods or their packaging.
         For example:                                      
         a. A clause on a multimodal transport document such as “packaging is not
           sufficient for the sea journey” or words of similar effect is an example of a
           clause expressly declaring a defective condition of the packaging.
         b. A clause on a multimodal transport document such as “packaging may not
           be sufficient for the sea journey” or words of similar effect does not expressly
           declare a defective condition of the packaging. 
      D25) a. It is not necessary for the word “clean” to appear on a multimodal transport
           document even when the credit requires a multimodal transport document to
           be marked “clean on board” or “clean”.          
         b. Deletion of the word “clean” on a multimodal transport document does not
           expressly declare a defective condition of the goods or their packaging.

         Goods description                                 
                                                           
      D26) A goods description indicated on a multimodal transport document may be in
         general terms not in conflict with the goods description in the credit.
         Indication of name and address of delivery agent at destination
      D27) When a credit requires a multimodal transport document to indicate the name,
         address and contact details of a delivery agent or words of similar effect, at or for
         the place of final destination or port of discharge, the address need not be one
         that is located at the place of destination or port of discharge or within the same
         country as that of the place of destination or port of discharge.
         Corrections and alterations (“corrections”)       
                                                           
      D28) Any correction of data on a multimodal transport document is to be
         authenticated. Such authentication is to appear to have been made by the
         carrier, master (captain) or any one of their named agents, who may be different
         from the agent that may have issued or signed a multimodal transport document,
         provided they are identified as an agent of the carrier or master (captain).
      D29) Non-negotiable copies of a multimodal transport document need not include
         authentication of any corrections that may have been made on the original.
         Freight and additional costs                      
      D30) A statement appearing on a multimodal transport document indicating the
         payment of freight need not be identical to that stated in the credit, but is not to
         conflict with data in that document, any other stipulated document or the credit.
         For example, when a credit requires a multimodal transport document to be
         marked “freight payable at destination”, it may be marked “freight collect”.
      D31) a. When a credit states that costs additional to freight are not acceptable, a
           multimodal transport document is not to indicate that costs additional to the
           freight have been or will be incurred.          
         b. An indication of costs additional to freight may be made by express reference
           to additional costs or by the use of trade terms which refer to costs associated
           with the loading or unloading of goods, such as, but not limited to, Free In (FI),
           Free Out (FO), Free In and Out (FIO) and Free In and Out Stowed (FIOS).
         c. Reference in a multimodal transport document to costs which may be levied,
           for example, as a result of a delay in unloading the goods, or after the goods
           have been unloaded (demurrage costs) or costs covering the late return of
           containers (detention costs) is not an indication of costs additional to freight.

         Release of goods with more than one multimodal transport
         document to be surrendered                        
                                                           
      D32) A multimodal transport document is not to expressly state that goods covered
         by that multimodal transport document will only be released upon its surrender
         together with one or more other multimodal transport documents, unless all of the
         referenced multimodal transport documents form part of the same presentation
         under the same credit.                            
         For example, “Container XXXX is covered by B/L No. YYY and ZZZ, and can only
         be released to a single merchant upon presentation of all multimodal transport
         documents of that merchant” is considered to be an express statement that
         one or more other multimodal transport documents, related to the referenced
         container or packing unit, must be surrendered prior to the goods being released.

         Bill of lading                                    
                                                           
                                                           
                                                           
                                                           
         Application of UCP 600 Article 20                 
                                                           
      E1) a. A requirement in a credit for the presentation of a transport document,
           however named, only covering a port-to-port shipment, i.e., a credit that
           contains no reference to a place of receipt or taking in charge or place of final
           destination means that UCP 600 article 20 is to be applied in the examination
           of that document.                               
         b. A bill of lading is not to contain any indication of a charter party as described
           in paragraphs G2) (a) and (b).                  
      E2) A bill of lading need not be titled “marine bill of lading”, “ocean bill of lading”, “port-
         to-port bill of lading” or words of similar effect even when the credit so names the
         required document.                                
         Issuance, carrier, identification of the carrier and signing of a bill
         of lading                                         
      E3) a. A bill of lading may be issued by any entity other than a carrier or master
           (captain), provided it meets the requirements of UCP 600 article 20.
         b. When a credit indicates “Freight Forwarder’s Bill of Lading is acceptable” or
           “House Bill of Lading is acceptable” or words of similar effect, a bill of lading
           may be signed by the issuing entity without it being necessary to indicate the
           capacity in which it has been signed or the name of the carrier.
      E4) A stipulation in a credit that “Freight Forwarder’s Bills of Lading are not
         acceptable” or “House Bills of Lading are not acceptable” or words of similar
         effect has no meaning in the context of the title, format, content or signing of a
         bill of lading unless the credit provides specific requirements detailing how the bill
         of lading is to be issued and signed. In the absence of these requirements, such a
         stipulation is to be disregarded, and the bill of lading presented is to be examined
         according to the requirements of UCP 600 article 20.
      E5) a. A bill of lading is to be signed in the form described in UCP 600 sub-article 20
           (a) (i) and to indicate the name of the carrier, identified as the carrier.
         b. When a bill of lading is signed by a named branch of the carrier, the signature
           is considered to have been made by the carrier. 
         c. When an agent signs a bill of lading for [or on behalf of] the carrier, the agent
           is to be named and, in addition, to indicate that it is signing as “agent for
           (name), the carrier” or as “agent on behalf of (name), the carrier” or words of
           similar effect. When the carrier is identified elsewhere in the document as the
           “carrier”, the named agent may sign, for example, as “agent for [or on behalf
           of] the carrier” without naming the carrier again.
         d. When the master (captain) signs a bill of lading, the signature of the master
           (captain) is to be identified as the “master” (“captain”). The name of the
           master (captain) need not be stated.

         e. When the master (captain) signs a bill of lading, the signature may be
           accompanied by a stamp that incorporates the name of the vessel. Even
           if the stamp also mentions the name of the owner, the bill of lading will be
           considered to have been signed by the master (captain). This stamp is often
           referred to as the ‘ship’s stamp’.              
         f. When an agent signs a bill of lading for [or on behalf of] the master (captain),
           the agent is to be named and, in addition, to indicate that it is signing as
           “agent for the master (or captain)”, or as “agent on behalf of the master (or
           captain)” or words of similar effect. The name of the master (captain) need
           not be stated.                                  
         On board notation, date of shipment, pre-carriage, place
         of receipt and port of loading                    
      E6) a. When a pre-printed “Shipped on board” bill of lading is presented, its issuance
           date will be deemed to be the date of shipment unless it bears a separate
           dated on board notation. In the latter event, such date will be deemed to be
           the date of shipment whether that date is before or after the issuance date
           of the bill of lading. The on board date may also be indicated in a designated
           field or box.                                   
         b. Notwithstanding that a credit may require a bill of lading to evidence a port-
           to-port shipment:                               
           i. when a bill of lading indicates a place of receipt that is the same as the
             port of loading, for example, place of receipt Rotterdam CY and the port of
             loading Rotterdam, and there is no indication of a means of pre-carriage
             (either in the pre-carriage field or the place of receipt field); or
           ii. when a bill of lading indicates a place of receipt different from the port
             of loading, for example, place of receipt Amsterdam and port of loading
             Rotterdam, and there is no indication of a means of pre-carriage (either in
             the pre-carriage field or the place of receipt field), then:
             (a) when a bill of lading is pre-printed “shipped on board”, the date of
               issue will be deemed to be the date of shipment, and no further on
               board notation is required.                 
             (b) when a bill of lading is pre-printed “received for shipment”, a dated on
               board notation is required, and the date appearing in the notation will
               be deemed to be the date of shipment. The on board date may also
               be indicated in a designated field or box.  
         c. Notwithstanding that a credit may require a bill of lading to evidence a port-
           to-port shipment, when a bill of lading:        
           i. indicates a place of receipt different from the port of loading, for example,
             place of receipt Amsterdam and port of loading Rotterdam, and there
             is an indication of a means of pre-carriage (either in the pre-carriage
             field or the place of receipt field), regardless of whether it is pre-printed
             “shipped on board” or “received for shipment”, it is to bear a dated on
             board notation which also indicates the name of the vessel and the
             port of loading stated in the credit. Such notation may also appear in a
             designated field or box. The date appearing in the on board notation or
             designated field or box will be deemed to be the date of shipment.

           ii. indicates a means of pre-carriage (either in the pre-carriage field or
             the place of receipt field), no matter if no place of receipt is stated or
             whether it is pre-printed “shipped on board” or “received for shipment”,
             it is to bear a dated on board notation which also indicates the name of
             the vessel and the port of loading stated in the credit. Such notation may
             also appear in a designated field or box. The date appearing in the on
             board notation or designated field or box will be deemed to be the date
             of shipment.                                  
         d. When a bill of lading indicates wording such as “When the place of receipt
           box has been completed, any notation on this bill of lading of “on board”,
           “loaded on board” or words of similar effect shall be deemed to be on board
           the means of transportation performing the carriage from the place of
           receipt to the port of loading” or words of similar effect, and if, in addition,
           the place of receipt box is completed, a bill of lading is to bear a dated on
           board notation. The dated on board notation is also to indicate the name
           of the vessel and the port of loading stated in the credit. Such notation may
           also appear in a designated field or box. The date appearing in the on board
           notation or designated field or box will be deemed to be the date of shipment.
         e. The named port of loading, as required by the credit, should appear in the
           port of loading field on a bill of lading. However, it may also be stated in
           the field headed “Place of receipt” or words of similar effect, provided there
           is a dated on board notation evidencing that the goods were shipped on
           board a named vessel at the port stated under “Place of receipt” or words of
           similar effect.                                 
         f. A bill of lading is to indicate the port of loading stated in the credit. When a
           credit indicates the port of loading by also stating the country in which the
           port is located, the name of the country need not be stated.
         g. When a credit indicates a geographical area or range of ports of loading (for
           example, “Any European Port” or “Hamburg, Rotterdam, Antwerp Port”), a bill
           of lading is to indicate the actual port of loading, which is to be within that
           geographical area or range of ports. A bill of lading need not indicate the
           geographical area.                              
         h. When a bill of lading indicates more than one port of loading, it is to evidence
           an on board notation with the relevant on board date for each port of loading,
           regardless of whether it is pre-printed “received for shipment” or “shipped on
           board”. For example, when a bill of lading indicates that shipment has been
           effected from Brisbane and Adelaide, a dated on board notation is required for
           both Brisbane and Adelaide.                     
      E7) Terms such as “Shipped in apparent good order”, “Laden on board”, “Clean on
         board” or other phrases that incorporate “shipped” or “on board” have the same
         effect as the words “Shipped on board”.

      E8) a. The named port of discharge, as required by the credit, should appear in the
           port of discharge field within a bill of lading.
         b. However, the named port of discharge may be stated in the field headed
           “Place of final destination” or words of similar effect provided there is a
           notation evidencing that the port of discharge is that stated under “Place of
           final destination” or words of similar effect. For example, when a credit requires
           shipment to be effected to Felixstowe, but Felixstowe is shown as the place of
           final destination instead of the port of discharge, this may be evidenced by a
           notation stating “Port of discharge Felixstowe”.
      E9) A bill of lading is to indicate the port of discharge stated in the credit. When a
         credit indicates the port of discharge by also stating the country in which the port
         is located, the name of the country need not be stated.
      E10) When a credit indicates a geographical area or range of ports of discharge
         (for example, “Any European Port” or “Hamburg, Rotterdam, Antwerp Port”), a
         bill of lading is to indicate the actual port of discharge, which is to be within
         that geographical area or range of ports. A bill of lading need not indicate the
         geographical area.                                
         Original bill of lading                           
      E11) a. A bill of lading is to indicate the number of originals that have been issued.
         b. Bills of lading marked “First Original”, “Second Original”, “Third Original”, or
           “Original”, “Duplicate”, “Triplicate” or similar expressions are all originals.
         Consignee, order party, shipper and endorsement,  
         and notify party                                  
      E12) When a credit requires a bill of lading to evidence that goods are consigned to
         a named entity, for example, “consigned to (named entity)” (i.e., a “straight” bill
         of lading or consignment) rather than “to order” or “to order of (named entity)”, it
         is not to contain the expressions “to order” or “to order of” preceding the named
         entity, or the expression “or order” following the named entity, whether typed or
         pre-printed.                                      
      E13) a. When a bill of lading is issued “to order” or “to order of the shipper”, it is to be
           endorsed by the shipper. An endorsement may be made by a named entity
           other than the shipper, provided the endorsement is made for [or on behalf of]
           the shipper.                                    
         b. When a credit requires a bill of lading to evidence that goods are consigned
           “to order of (named entity)”, it is not to indicate that the goods are straight
           consigned to that named entity.                 
      E14) a. When a credit stipulates the details of one or more notify parties, a bill of
           lading may also indicate the details of one or more additional notify parties.
         b. i. When a credit does not stipulate the details of a notify party, a bill of
             lading may indicate the details of any notify party and in any manner
             (except as stated in paragraph E14) (b) (ii)).
           ii. When a credit does not stipulate the details of a notify party, but the
             details of the applicant appear as notify party on a bill of lading, and

             these details include the applicant’s address and contact details, they are
             not to conflict with those stated in the credit.
      E15) When a credit requires a bill of lading to evidence goods consigned to or to the
         order of “issuing bank” or “applicant“ or notify “applicant” or “issuing bank”, a bill
         of lading is to indicate the name of the issuing bank or applicant, as applicable,
         but need not indicate their respective addresses or any contact details that may
         be stated in the credit.                          
      E16) When the address and contact details of the applicant appear as part of the
         consignee or notify party details, they are not to conflict with those stated in
         the credit.                                       
         Transhipment, partial shipment and determining the presentation
         period when multiple sets of bills of lading are presented
                                                           
      E17) Transhipment is the unloading and reloading of goods from one vessel to another
         during the carriage of those goods from the port of loading to the port of
         discharge stated in the credit. When a bill of lading does not indicate unloading
         and reloading between these two ports, it is not transhipment in the context of the
         credit and UCP 600 sub-articles 20 (b) and (c).   
      E18) Shipment on more than one vessel is a partial shipment, even if each vessel leaves
         on the same day for the same destination.         
      E19) a. When a credit prohibits partial shipment, and more than one set of original
           bills of lading are presented covering shipment from one or more ports of
           loading (as specifically allowed, or within a geographical area or range of
           ports stated in the credit), each set is to indicate that it covers the shipment of
           goods on the same vessel and same journey and that the goods are destined
           for the same port of discharge.                 
         b. When a credit prohibits partial shipment, and more than one set of original
           bills of lading are presented in accordance with paragraph E19) (a) and
           incorporate different dates of shipment, the latest of these dates is to be used
           for the calculation of any presentation period and must fall on or before the
           latest shipment date stated in the credit.      
         c. When partial shipment is allowed, and more than one set of original bills
           of lading are presented as part of a single presentation made under one
           covering schedule or letter and incorporate different dates of shipment, on
           different vessels or the same vessel for a different journey, the earliest of these
           dates is to be used for the calculation of any presentation period, and each of
           these dates must fall on or before the latest shipment date stated in the credit.
         Clean bill of lading                              
      E20) A bill of lading is not to include a clause or clauses that expressly declare a
         defective condition of the goods or their packaging.

         For example:                                      
                                                           
         a. A clause on a bill of lading such as “packaging is not sufficient for the
           sea journey” or words of similar effect is an example of a clause expressly
           declaring a defective condition of the packaging.
         b. A clause on a bill of lading such as “packaging may not be sufficient for the
           sea journey” or words of similar effect does not expressly declare a defective
           condition of the packaging.                     
      E21) a. It is not necessary for the word “clean” to appear on a bill of lading even when
           the credit requires a bill of lading to be marked “clean on board” or “clean”.
         b. Deletion of the word “clean” on a bill of lading does not expressly declare a
           defective condition of the goods or their packaging.
         Goods description                                 
      E22) A goods description indicated on a bill of lading may be in general terms not in
         conflict with the goods description in the credit.
         Indication of name and address of delivery agent at port
         of discharge                                      
      E23) When a credit requires a bill of lading to indicate the name, address and contact
         details of a delivery agent or words of similar effect, at or for the port of discharge,
         the address need not be one that is located at the port of discharge or within the
         same country as that of the port of discharge.    
                                                           
         Corrections and alterations (“corrections”)       
      E24) Any correction of data on a bill of lading is to be authenticated. Such
         authentication is to appear to have been made by the carrier, master (captain)
         or any one of their named agents, who may be different from the agent that may
         have issued or signed a bill of lading, provided they are identified as an agent of
         the carrier or the master (captain).              
      E25) Non-negotiable copies of a bill of lading need not include authentication of any
         corrections that may have been made on the original.
         Freight and additional costs                      
      E26) A statement appearing on a bill of lading indicating the payment of freight need
         not be identical to that stated in the credit, but is not to conflict with data in that
         document, any other stipulated document or the credit. For example, when a
         credit requires a bill of lading to be marked “freight payable at destination”, it may
         be marked “freight collect”.                      
      E27) a. When a credit states that costs additional to freight are not acceptable, a bill
           of lading is not to indicate that costs additional to the freight have been or will
           be incurred.                                    
         b. An indication of costs additional to freight may be made by express reference
           to additional costs or by the use of trade terms which refer to costs associated
           with the loading or unloading of goods, such as, but not limited to, Free In (FI),
           Free Out (FO), Free In and Out (FIO) and Free In and Out Stowed (FIOS).

         c. Reference in a bill of lading to costs which may be levied, for example, as
           a result of a delay in unloading the goods, or after the goods have been
           unloaded (demurrage costs) or costs covering the late return of containers
           (detention costs) is not an indication of costs additional to freight.
                                                           
         Release of goods with more than one bill of lading
         to be surrendered                                 
      E28) A bill of lading is not to expressly state that goods covered by that bill of lading will
         only be released upon its surrender together with one or more other bills of lading,
         unless all of the referenced bills of lading form part of the same presentation
         under the same credit.                            
         For example, “Container XXXX is covered by B/L No. YYY and ZZZ and can only
         be released to a single merchant upon presentation of all bills of lading of that
         merchant” is considered to be an express statement that one or more other bills of
         lading, related to the referenced container or packing unit, must be surrendered
         prior to the goods being released.

      F1) a. A requirement in a credit for the presentation of a non-negotiable sea waybill,
           covering a port-to-port shipment only, i.e., a credit that contains no reference
           to a place of receipt or taking in charge or place of final destination means
           that UCP 600 article 21 is to be applied in the examination of that document.
         b. A non-negotiable sea waybill is not to contain any indication of a charter party
           as described in paragraphs G2) (a) and (b).     
         Issuance, carrier, identification of the carrier and signing
         of a non-negotiable sea waybill                   
      F2) a. A non-negotiable sea waybill may be issued by any entity other than a carrier
           or master (captain) provided it meets the requirements of UCP 600 article 21.
         b. When a credit indicates “Freight Forwarder’s non-negotiable sea waybill is
           acceptable” or “House non-negotiable sea waybill is acceptable” or words of
           similar effect, a non-negotiable sea waybill may be signed by the issuing entity
           without it being necessary to indicate the capacity in which it has been signed
           or the name of the carrier.                     
      F3) A stipulation in a credit that “Freight Forwarder’s non-negotiable sea waybill is not
         acceptable” or “House non-negotiable sea waybill is not acceptable” or words of
         similar effect has no meaning in the context of the title, format, content or signing
         of a non-negotiable sea waybill unless the credit provides specific requirements
         detailing how the non-negotiable sea waybill is to be issued and signed. In the
         absence of these requirements, such a stipulation is to be disregarded, and
         the non-negotiable sea waybill presented is to be examined according to the
         requirements of UCP 600 article 21.               
      F4) a. A non-negotiable sea waybill is to be signed in the form described in UCP 600
           sub-article 21 (a) (i) and to indicate the name of the carrier, identified as the
           carrier.                                        
         b. When a non-negotiable sea waybill is signed by a named branch of the
           carrier, the signature is considered to have been made by the carrier.
         c. When an agent signs a non-negotiable sea waybill for [or on behalf of] the
           carrier, the agent is to be named and, in addition, to indicate that it is signing
           as “agent for (name), the carrier” or as “agent on behalf of (name), the carrier”
           or words of similar effect. When the carrier is identified elsewhere in the
           document as the “carrier”, the named agent may sign, for example, as “agent
           for [or on behalf of] the carrier” without naming the carrier again.
         d. When the master (captain) signs a non-negotiable sea waybill, the signature
           of the master (captain) is to be identified as the “master” (“captain”). The
           name of the master (captain) need not be stated.
         e. When the master (captain) signs a non-negotiable sea waybill, the signature
           may be accompanied by a stamp that incorporates the name of the vessel.

      International Standard Banking Practice for the Examination of Documents under UCP 600
                                                           
           Even if the stamp also mentions the name of the owner, the non-negotiable
           sea waybill will be considered to have been signed by the master (captain).
           This stamp is often referred to as the ‘ship’s stamp’.
         f. When an agent signs a non-negotiable sea waybill for [or on behalf of] the
           master (captain), the agent is to be named and, in addition, to indicate that
           it is signing as “agent for the master (or captain)”, or as “agent on behalf of
           the master (or captain)” or words of similar effect. The name of the master
           (captain) need not be stated.                   
         On board notation, date of shipment, pre-carriage, place
         of receipt and port of loading                    
                                                           
      F5) a. When a pre-printed “Shipped on board” non-negotiable sea waybill is
           presented, its issuance date will be deemed to be the date of shipment unless
           it bears a separate dated on board notation. In the latter event, such date will
           be deemed to be the date of shipment whether that date is before or after the
           issuance date of the non-negotiable sea waybill. The on board date may also
           be indicated in a designated field or box.      
         b. Notwithstanding that a credit may require a non-negotiable sea waybill to
           evidence a port-to-port shipment:               
           i. when a non-negotiable sea waybill indicates a place of receipt that is the
             same as the port of loading, for example, place of receipt Rotterdam CY
             and the port of loading Rotterdam, and there is no indication of a means
             of pre-carriage (either in the pre-carriage field or the place of receipt
             field); or                                    
           ii. when a non-negotiable sea waybill indicates a place of receipt different
             from the port of loading, for example, place of receipt Amsterdam and
             port of loading Rotterdam, and there is no indication of a means of pre-
             carriage (either in the pre-carriage field or the place of receipt field), then:
             (a) when a non-negotiable sea waybill is pre-printed “shipped on board”,
               the date of issue will be deemed to be the date of shipment, and no
               further on board notation is required.      
             (b) when a non-negotiable sea waybill is pre-printed “received for
               shipment”, a dated on board notation is required, and the date
               appearing in the notation will be deemed to be the date of shipment.
               The on board date may also be indicated in a designated field or box.
         c. Notwithstanding that a credit may require a non-negotiable sea waybill to
           evidence a port-to-port shipment, when a non-negotiable sea waybill:
           i. indicates a place of receipt different from the port of loading, for example,
             place of receipt Amsterdam and port of loading Rotterdam, and there
             is an indication of a means of pre-carriage (either in the pre-carriage
             field or the place of receipt field), regardless of whether it is pre-printed
             “shipped on board” or “received for shipment”, it is to bear a dated on
             board notation which also indicates the name of the vessel and the
             port of loading stated in the credit. Such notation may also appear in a
             designated field or box. The date appearing in the on board notation or
             designated field or box will be deemed to be the date of shipment.

           ii. indicates a means of pre-carriage (either in the pre-carriage field or
             the place of receipt field), no matter if no place of receipt is stated or
             whether it is pre-printed “shipped on board” or “received for shipment”,
             it is to bear a dated on board notation which also indicates the name of
             the vessel and the port of loading stated in the credit. Such notation may
             also appear in a designated field or box. The date appearing in the on
             board notation or designated field or box will be deemed to be the date
             of shipment.                                  
         d. When a non-negotiable sea waybill indicates wording such as “When the
           place of receipt box has been completed, any notation on this non-negotiable
           sea waybill of “on board”, “loaded on board” or words of similar effect shall be
           deemed to be on board the means of transportation performing the carriage
           from the place of receipt to the port of loading” or words of similar effect, and
           if, in addition, the place of receipt box is completed, a non-negotiable sea
           waybill is to bear a dated on board notation. The dated on board notation is
           also to indicate the name of the vessel and the port of loading stated in the
           credit. Such notation may also appear in a designated field or box. The date
           appearing in the on board notation or designated field or box will be deemed
           to be the date of shipment.                     
         e. The named port of loading, as required by the credit, should appear in the
           port of loading field on a non-negotiable sea waybill. However, it may also be
           stated in the field headed “Place of receipt” or words of similar effect, provided
           there is a dated on board notation evidencing that the goods were shipped on
           board a named vessel at the port stated under “Place of receipt” or words of
           similar effect.                                 
         f. A non-negotiable sea waybill is to indicate the port of loading stated in the
           credit. When a credit indicates the port of loading by also stating the country
           in which the port is located, the name of the country need not be stated.
         g. When a credit indicates a geographical area or range of ports of loading (for
           example, “Any European Port” or “Hamburg, Rotterdam, Antwerp Port”), a non-
           negotiable sea waybill is to indicate the actual port of loading, which is to be
           within that geographical area or range of ports. A non-negotiable sea waybill
           need not indicate the geographical area.        
         h. When a non-negotiable sea waybill indicates more than one port of loading, it
           is to evidence an on board notation with the relevant on board date for each
           port of loading, regardless of whether it is pre-printed “received for shipment”
           or “shipped on board”. For example, when a non-negotiable sea waybill
           indicates that shipment has been effected from Brisbane and Adelaide, a
           dated on board notation is required for both Brisbane and Adelaide.
      F6) Terms such as “Shipped in apparent good order”, “Laden on board”, “Clean on
         board” or other phrases that incorporate “shipped” or “on board” have the same
         effect as the words “Shipped on board”.           
         Port of discharge                                 
      F7) a. The named port of discharge, as required by the credit, should appear in the
           port of discharge field within a non-negotiable sea waybill.

         b. However, the named port of discharge may be stated in the field headed
           “Place of final destination” or words of similar effect provided there is a
           notation evidencing that the port of discharge is that stated under “Place of
           final destination” or words of similar effect. For example, when a credit requires
           shipment to be effected to Felixstowe, but Felixstowe is shown as the place of
           final destination instead of the port of discharge, this may be evidenced by a
           notation stating “Port of discharge Felixstowe”.
      F8) A non-negotiable sea waybill is to indicate the port of discharge stated in the
         credit. When a credit indicates the port of discharge by also stating the country in
         which the port is located, the name of the country need not be stated.
      F9) When a credit indicates a geographical area or range of ports of discharge (for
         example “Any European Port” or “Hamburg, Rotterdam, Antwerp Port”), a non-
         negotiable sea waybill is to indicate the actual port of discharge, which is to be
         within that geographical area or range of ports. A non-negotiable sea waybill
         need not indicate the geographical area.          
         Original non-negotiable sea waybill               
      F10) a. A non-negotiable sea waybill is to indicate the number of originals that have
           been issued.                                    
         b. Non-negotiable sea waybills marked “First Original”, “Second Original”, “Third
           Original”, or “Original”, “Duplicate”, “Triplicate” or similar expressions are all
           originals.                                      
         Consignee, order party, shipper, and notify party 
      F11) a. When a credit requires a non-negotiable sea waybill to evidence that goods
           are consigned to a named entity, for example, “consigned to (named entity)”,
           it is not to contain the expressions “to order” or “to order of” preceding the
           named entity, or the expression “or order” following the named entity, whether
           typed or pre-printed.                           
         b. When a credit requires a non-negotiable sea waybill to evidence that goods
           are consigned “to order of (named entity)”, it may indicate that the goods are
           consigned to that entity, without mentioning “to order of”.
         c. When a credit requires a non-negotiable sea waybill to evidence that goods
           are consigned “to order” without naming the entity to whose order the goods
           are to be consigned, it is to indicate that the goods are consigned to either
           the issuing bank or the applicant, without the need to mention the words “to
           order”.                                         
      F12) a. When a credit stipulates the details of one or more notify parties, a non-
           negotiable sea waybill may also indicate the details of one or more additional
           notify parties.                                 
         b. i. When a credit does not stipulate the details of a notify party, a non-
             negotiable sea waybill may indicate the details of any notify party and in
             any manner (except as stated in paragraph F12) (b) (ii)).
           ii. When a credit does not stipulate the details of a notify party, but the
             details of the applicant appear as notify party on a non-negotiable sea
             waybill, and these details include the applicant’s address and contact
             details, they are not to conflict with those stated in the credit.

      F13) When a credit requires a non-negotiable sea waybill to evidence goods consigned
         to “issuing bank” or “applicant“ or notify “applicant” or “issuing bank”, a non-
         negotiable sea waybill is to indicate the name of the issuing bank or applicant, as
         applicable, but need not indicate their respective addresses or any contact details
         that may be stated in the credit.                 
      F14) When the address and contact details of the applicant appear as part of the
         consignee or notify party details, they are not to conflict with those stated in
         the credit.                                       
         Transhipment, partial shipment and determining    
         the presentation period when multiple sets of non-negotiable sea
         waybills are presented                            
      F15) Transhipment is the unloading and reloading of goods from one vessel to
         another during the carriage of those goods from the port of loading to the port
         of discharge stated in the credit. When a non-negotiable sea waybill does not
         indicate unloading and reloading between these two ports, it is not transhipment
         in the context of the credit and UCP 600 sub-articles 21 (b) and (c).
      F16) Shipment on more than one vessel is a partial shipment, even if each vessel leaves
         on the same day for the same destination.         
      F17) a. When a credit prohibits partial shipment, and more than one set of original
           non-negotiable sea waybills are presented covering shipment from one or
           more ports of loading (as specifically allowed, or within a geographical area
           or range of ports stated in the credit), each set is to indicate that it covers the
           shipment of goods on the same vessel and same journey and that the goods
           are destined for the same port of discharge.    
         b. When a credit prohibits partial shipment, and more than one set of original
           non-negotiable sea waybills are presented in accordance with paragraph F17)
           (a) and incorporate different dates of shipment, the latest of these dates is
           to be used for the calculation of any presentation period and must fall on or
           before the latest shipment date stated in the credit.
         c. When partial shipment is allowed, and more than one set of original non-
           negotiable sea waybills are presented as part of a single presentation made
           under one covering schedule or letter and incorporate different dates of
           shipment, on different vessels or the same vessel for a different journey, the
           earliest of these dates is to be used for the calculation of any presentation
           period, and each of these dates must fall on or before the latest shipment
           date stated in the credit.                      
         Clean non-negotiable sea waybill                  
      F18) A non-negotiable sea waybill is not to include a clause or clauses that expressly
         declare a defective condition of the goods or their packaging.
         For example:                                      
         a. A clause on a non-negotiable sea waybill such as “packaging is not sufficient
           for the sea journey” or words of similar effect is an example of a clause
           expressly declaring a defective condition of the packaging.

         b. A clause on a non-negotiable sea waybill such as “packaging may not be
           sufficient for the sea journey” or words of similar effect does not expressly
           declare a defective condition of the packaging. 
      F19) a. It is not necessary for the word “clean” to appear on a non-negotiable sea
           waybill even when the credit requires a non-negotiable sea waybill to be
           marked “clean on board” or “clean”.             
         b. Deletion of the word “clean” on a non-negotiable sea waybill does not
           expressly declare a defective condition of the goods or their packaging.
                                                           
         Goods description                                 
      F20) A goods description indicated on a non-negotiable sea waybill may be in general
         terms not in conflict with the goods description in the credit.
         Indication of name and address of delivery agent at port
         of discharge                                      
      F21) When a credit requires a non-negotiable sea waybill to indicate the name, address
         and contact details of a delivery agent or words of similar effect, at or for the port
         of discharge, the address need not be one that is located at the port of discharge
         or within the same country as that of the port of discharge.
         Corrections and alterations (“corrections”)       
                                                           
      F22) Any correction of data on a non-negotiable sea waybill is to be authenticated.
         Such authentication is to appear to have been made by the carrier, master
         (captain) or any one of their named agents, who may be different from the agent
         that may have issued or signed a non-negotiable sea waybill, provided they are
         identified as an agent of the carrier or the master (captain).
      F23) Copies of a non-negotiable sea waybill need not include authentication of any
         corrections that may have been made on the original.
         Freight and additional costs                      
      F24) A statement appearing on a non-negotiable sea waybill indicating the payment of
         freight need not be identical to that stated in the credit, but is not to conflict with
         data in that document, any other stipulated document or the credit. For example,
         when a credit requires a non-negotiable sea waybill to be marked “freight payable
         at destination”, it may be marked “freight collect”.
      F25) a. When a credit states that costs additional to freight are not acceptable,
           a non-negotiable sea waybill is not to indicate that costs additional to the
           freight have been or will be incurred.          
         b. An indication of costs additional to freight may be made by express reference
           to additional costs or by the use of trade terms which refer to costs associated
           with the loading or unloading of goods, such as, but not limited to, Free In (FI),
           Free Out (FO), Free In and Out (FIO) and Free In and Out Stowed (FIOS).
         c. Reference in a non-negotiable sea waybill to costs which may be levied, for
           example, as a result of a delay in unloading the goods, or after the goods
           have been unloaded (demurrage costs) or costs covering the late return of
           containers (detention costs) is not an indication of costs additional to freight.

      G1 When there is a requirement in a credit for the presentation of a charter party bill
         of lading, or when a credit allows presentation of a charter party bill of lading and
         a charter party bill of lading is presented, UCP 600 article 22 is to be applied in the
         examination of that document.                     
      G2) a. A transport document, however named, containing any indication that it is
           subject to, or any reference to, a charter party is deemed to be a charter party
           bill of lading.                                 
         b. A transport document, however named, indicating expressions such as
           “freight payable as per charter party dated (with or without mentioning a
           date)”, or “freight payable as per charter party”, will be an indication that it is
           subject to a charter party.                     
      G3) A transport document, however named, containing a code name or form name
         usually associated with a charter party bill of lading, for example, ”Congenbill”
         or ”Tanker Bill of Lading” without any further indication or reference to a charter
         party, is not by itself an indication of, or reference to, a charter party.
         Signing of a charter party bill of lading         
      G4) a. A charter party bill of lading is to be signed in the form described in UCP 600
           sub-article 22 (a) (i).                         
         b. When the master (captain), owner or charterer signs a charter party bill of
           lading, the signature of the master (captain), owner or charterer is to be
           identified as “master” (“captain”), “owner” or “charterer”.
         c. When the master (captain) signs a charter party bill of lading, the signature
           may be accompanied by a stamp that incorporates the name of the vessel.
           Even if the stamp also mentions the name of the owner, the charter party bill
           of lading will be considered to have been signed by the master (captain). This
           stamp is often referred to as the ‘ship’s stamp’.
         d. When an agent signs a charter party bill of lading for [or on behalf of]
           the master (captain), owner or charterer, the agent is to be named and, in
           addition, to indicate that it is signing as agent for [or on behalf of] the master
           (captain), owner or charterer as the case may be.
           i. When a charter party bill of lading is signed by an agent for [or on behalf
             of] the master (captain), the name of the master (captain) need not
             be stated.                                    
           ii. When a charter party bill of lading is signed by an agent for [or on behalf

         of receipt and port of loading                    
                                                           
      G5) a. When a pre-printed “Shipped on board” charter party bill of lading is
           presented, its issuance date will be deemed to be the date of shipment unless
           it bears a separate dated on board notation. In the latter event, such date will
           be deemed to be the date of shipment whether that date is before or after the
           issuance date of the charter party bill of lading. The on board date may also
           be indicated in a designated field or box.      
         b. Notwithstanding that a credit may require a charter party bill of lading to
           evidence a port-to-port shipment:               
           i. when a charter party bill of lading indicates a place of receipt that is the
             same as the port of loading, for example, place of receipt Rotterdam CY
             and the port of loading Rotterdam, and there is no indication of a means
             of pre-carriage (either in the pre-carriage field or the place of receipt
             field); or                                    
           ii. when a charter party bill of lading indicates a place of receipt different
             from the port of loading, for example, place of receipt Amsterdam and
             port of loading Rotterdam, and there is no indication of a means of pre-
             carriage (either in the pre-carriage field or the place of receipt field), then:
             (a) when a charter party bill of lading is pre-printed “shipped on board”,
               the date of issue will be deemed to be the date of shipment, and no
               further on board notation is required.      
             (b) when a charter party bill of lading is pre-printed “received for
               shipment”, a dated on board notation is required, and the date
               appearing in the notation will be deemed to be the date of shipment.
               The on board date may also be indicated in a designated field or box.
         c. Notwithstanding that a credit may require a charter party bill of lading to
           evidence a port-to-port shipment, when a charter party bill of lading:
           i. indicates a place of receipt different from the port of loading, for example,
             place of receipt Amsterdam and port of loading Rotterdam, and there
             is an indication of a means of pre-carriage (either in the pre-carriage
             field or the place of receipt field), regardless of whether it is pre-printed
             “shipped on board” or “received for shipment”, it is to bear a dated on
             board notation which also indicates the name of the vessel and the
             port of loading stated in the credit. Such notation may also appear in a
             designated field or box. The date appearing in the on board notation or
             designated field or box will be deemed to be the date of shipment.
           ii. indicates a means of pre-carriage (either in the pre-carriage field or
             the place of receipt field), no matter if no place of receipt is stated, or
             whether it is pre-printed “shipped on board” or “received for shipment”,
             it is to bear a dated on board notation which also indicates the name of
             the vessel and the port of loading stated in the credit. Such notation may
             also appear in a designated field or box. The date appearing in the on
             board notation or designated field or box will be deemed to be the date
             of shipment.

         d. When a charter party bill of lading shows wording such as “When the place
           of receipt box has been completed, any notation on this charter party bill
           of lading of “on board”, “loaded on board” or words of similar effect shall be
           deemed to be on board the means of transportation performing the carriage
           from the place of receipt to the port of loading” or words of similar effect,
           and if, in addition, the place of receipt box is completed, a charter party bill
           of lading is to bear a dated on board notation. The dated on board notation
           is also to indicate the name of the vessel and the port of loading stated in the
           credit. Such notation may also appear in a designated field or box. The date
           appearing in the on board notation or designated field or box will be deemed
           to be the date of shipment.                     
         e. The named port of loading, as required by the credit, should appear in the
           port of loading field on a charter party bill of lading. However, it may also be
           stated in the field headed “Place of receipt” or words of similar effect, provided
           there is a dated on board notation evidencing that the goods were shipped on
           board a named vessel at the port stated under “Place of receipt” or words of
           similar effect.                                 
         f. A charter party bill of lading is to indicate the port of loading stated in the
           credit. When a credit indicates the port of loading by also stating the country
           in which the port is located, the name of the country need not be stated.
         g. When a credit indicates a geographical area or range of ports of loading
           (for example, “Any European Port” or “Hamburg, Rotterdam, Antwerp Port”),
           a charter party bill of lading is to indicate the actual port or ports of loading,
           which are to be within that geographical area or range of ports. A charter
           party bill of lading need not indicate the geographical area.
         h. When a charter party bill of lading indicates more than one port of loading, it
           is to evidence an on board notation with the relevant on board date for each
           port of loading, regardless of whether it is pre-printed “received for shipment”
           or “shipped on board”. For example, when a charter party bill of lading
           indicates that shipment has been effected from Brisbane and Adelaide, a
           dated on board notation is required for both Brisbane and Adelaide.
      G6) Terms such as “Shipped in apparent good order”, “Laden on board”, “Clean on
         board” or other phrases that incorporate “shipped” or “on board” have the same
         effect as the words “Shipped on board”.           
         Port of discharge                                 
      G7) a. The named port of discharge, as required by the credit, should appear in the
           port of discharge field within a charter party bill of lading.
         b. However, the named port of discharge may be stated in the field headed
           “Place of final destination” or words of similar effect provided there is a
           notation evidencing that the port of discharge is that stated under “Place of
           final destination” or words of similar effect. For example, when a credit requires
           shipment to be effected to Felixstowe, but Felixstowe is shown as the place of
           final destination instead of the port of discharge, this may be evidenced by a
           notation stating “Port of discharge Felixstowe”.

      G8) A charter party bill of lading is to indicate the port of discharge stated in the
         credit. When a credit indicates the port of discharge by also stating the country in
         which the port is located, the name of the country need not be stated.
      G9) When a credit indicates a geographical area or range of ports of discharge (for
         example, “Any European Port” or “Hamburg, Rotterdam, Antwerp Port”), a charter
         party bill of lading may indicate the actual port of discharge, which is to be within
         that geographical area or range of ports, or it may show the geographical area or
         range of ports as the port of discharge.          
         Original charter party bill of lading             
                                                           
      G10) a. A charter party bill of lading is to indicate the number of originals that have
           been issued.                                    
         b. Charter party bills of lading marked “First Original”, “Second Original”, “Third
           Original”, or “Original”, “Duplicate”, “Triplicate” or similar expressions are
           all originals.                                  
         Consignee, order party, shipper and endorsement,  
         and notify party                                  
      G11) When a credit requires a charter party bill of lading to evidence that goods are
         consigned to a named entity, for example, “consigned to (named entity)” (i.e., a
         “straight” charter party bill of lading or consignment) rather than “to order” or “to
         order of (named entity)”, it is not to contain the expressions “to order” or “to order
         of” preceding the named entity or the expression “or order” following the named
         entity, whether typed or pre-printed.             
      G12) a. When a charter party bill of lading is issued “to order” or “to order of the
           shipper”, it is to be endorsed by the shipper. An endorsement may be made by
           a named entity other than the shipper, provided the endorsement is made for
           [or on behalf of] the shipper.                  
         b. When a credit requires a charter party bill of lading to evidence that goods
           are consigned “to order of (named entity)”, it is not to indicate that the goods
           are straight consigned to that named entity.    
      G13) a. When a credit stipulates the details of one or more notify parties, a charter
           party bill of lading may also indicate the details of one or more additional
           notify parties.                                 
         b. i. When a credit does not stipulate the details of a notify party, a charter
             party bill of lading may indicate the details of any notify party and in any
             manner (except as stated in paragraph G13) (b) (ii)).
           ii. When a credit does not stipulate the details of a notify party, but the
             details of the applicant appear as notify party on a charter party bill of
             lading, and these details include the applicant’s address and contact
             details, they are not to conflict with those stated in the credit.
      G14) When a credit requires a charter party bill of lading to evidence goods consigned
         to or to the order of “issuing bank” or “applicant” or notify applicant” or “issuing
         bank”, a charter party bill of lading is to indicate the name of the issuing bank
         or applicant, as applicable, but need not indicate their respective addresses or
         contact details that may be stated in the credit.

      G15) When the address and contact details of the applicant appear as part of the
         consignee or notify party details, they are not to conflict with those stated in
         the credit.                                       
                                                           
         Partial shipment and determining the presentation period when
         multiple sets of charter party bills of lading are presented
      G16) Shipment on more than one vessel is a partial shipment, even if each vessel leaves
         on the same day for the same destination.         
      G17) a. When a credit prohibits partial shipment, and more than one set of original
           charter party bills of lading are presented covering shipment from one or
           more ports of loading (as specifically allowed, or within a geographical area
           or range of ports stated in the credit), each set is to indicate that it covers the
           shipment of goods on the same vessel and same journey and that the goods
           are destined for the same port of discharge, geographical area or range
           of ports.                                       
         b. When a credit prohibits partial shipment, and more than one set of original
           charter party bills of lading are presented in accordance with paragraph G17)
           (a) and incorporate different dates of shipment, or one set of original charter
           party bills of lading is presented indicating different dates of shipment, the
           latest of these dates is to be used for the calculation of any presentation
           period and must fall on or before the latest shipment date stated in the credit.
         c. When partial shipment is allowed, and more than one set of original charter
           party bills of lading are presented as part of a single presentation made under
           one covering schedule or letter and incorporate different dates of shipment,
           on different vessels or the same vessel for a different journey, the earliest of
           these dates is to be used for the calculation of any presentation period, and
           each of these dates must fall on or before the latest shipment date stated in
           the credit.                                     
         Clean charter party bill of lading                
      G18) A charter party bill of lading is not to include a clause or clauses that expressly
         declare a defective condition of the goods or their packaging.
         For example:                                      
         a. A clause on a charter party bill of lading such as “packaging is not sufficient
           for the sea journey” or words of similar effect is an example of a clause
           expressly declaring a defective condition of the packaging.
         b. A clause on a charter party bill of lading such as “packaging may not be
           sufficient for the sea journey” or words of similar effect does not expressly
           declare a defective condition of the packaging. 
      G19) a. It is not necessary for the word “clean” to appear on a charter party bill of
           lading even when the credit requires a charter party bill of lading to be marked
           “clean on board” or “clean”.                    
         b. Deletion of the word “clean” on a charter party bill of lading does not expressly
           declare a defective condition of the goods or their packaging.

      G20) A goods description indicated on a charter party bill of lading may be in general
         terms not in conflict with the goods description in the credit.
      G21) A charter party bill of lading may indicate that the goods are part of a larger
         consignment loaded onto the named vessel by reference to “without segregation”,
         “commingled” or words of similar effect.          
         Corrections and alterations (“corrections”)       
      G22) Any correction of data on a charter party bill of lading is to be authenticated.
         Such authentication is to appear to have been made by the master (captain),
         owner, charterer or any one of their named agents, who may be different from the
         agent that may have issued or signed a charter party bill of lading, provided they
         are identified as an agent of the master (captain), owner or charterer.
      G23) Non-negotiable copies of a charter party bill of lading need not include
         authentication of any corrections that may have been made on the original.
         Freight and additional costs                      
      G24) A statement appearing on a charter party bill of lading indicating the payment of
         freight need not be identical to that stated in the credit but is not to conflict with
         data in that document, any other stipulated document or the credit. For example,
         when a credit requires a charter party bill of lading to be marked “freight payable
         at destination”, it may be marked “freight collect”.
      G25) a. When a credit states that costs additional to freight are not acceptable, a
           charter party bill of lading is not to indicate that costs additional to the freight
           have been or will be incurred.                  
         b. An indication of costs additional to freight may be made by express reference
           to additional costs or by the use of trade terms which refer to costs associated
           with the loading or unloading of goods, such as, but not limited to, Free In (FI),
           Free Out (FO), Free In and Out (FIO) and Free In and Out Stowed (FIOS).
         c. Reference in a charter party bill of lading to costs which may be levied, for
           example, as a result of a delay in unloading the goods or after the goods have
           been unloaded (demurrage costs) is not an indication of costs additional
           to freight.                                     
         Release of goods with more than one charter party bill of lading
         to be surrendered                                 
      G26) A charter party bill of lading is not to expressly state that goods covered by that
         charter party bill of lading will only be released upon its surrender together with
         one or more other charter party bills of lading, unless all of the referenced charter
         party bills of lading form part of the same presentation under the same credit.
         For example, “[Cargo XXXX] is covered by B/L No. YYY and ZZZ, and can only be
         released to a single merchant upon presentation of all charter party bills of lading
         of that merchant” is considered to be an express statement that one or more other
         charter party bills of lading, related to the referenced cargo, must be surrendered
         prior to the goods being released.

      G27) Unless UCP 600 sub-article 22 (b) is specifically excluded and the credit
         specifically indicates the data that are to be examined and to what extent, banks
         do not examine any content of a charter party contract, even when such contract
         is required as a stipulated document under the credit.

      H1) A requirement in a credit for the presentation of an air transport document,
         however named, covering an airport-to-airport shipment means that UCP 600
         article 23 is to be applied in the examination of that document.
      H2) An air transport document need not be titled “air waybill”, “air consignment note”
         or words of similar effect even when the credit so names the required document.
         Issuance, carrier, identification of the carrier and signing of an air
         transport document                                
      H3) a. An air transport document may be issued by any entity other than a carrier
           provided it meets the requirements of UCP 600 article 23.
         b. When a credit indicates “Freight Forwarder’s air waybill is acceptable” or
           “House air waybill is acceptable” or words of similar effect, an air transport
           document may be signed by the issuing entity without it being necessary to
           indicate the capacity in which it has been signed or the name of the carrier.
      H4) A stipulation in a credit that “Freight Forwarder’s air waybill is not acceptable” or
         “House air waybill is not acceptable” or words of similar effect has no meaning in
         the context of the title, format, content or signing of an air transport document
         unless the credit provides specific requirements detailing how the air transport
         document is to be issued and signed. In the absence of these requirements, such
         a stipulation is to be disregarded, and the air transport document presented is to
         be examined according to the requirements of UCP 600 article 23.
      H5) a. An air transport document is to be signed in the form described in UCP 600
           sub-article 23 (a) (i) and to indicate the name of the carrier, identified as
           the carrier.                                    
         b. When an air transport document is signed by a named branch of the carrier,
           the signature is considered to have been made by the carrier.
         c. The carrier is to be identified by its name instead of an IATA airline code, for
           example, British Airways instead of BA, Lufthansa instead of LH.
      H6) When an agent signs an air transport document “for [or on behalf of] the carrier”,
         the agent is to be named and, in addition, to indicate that it is signing as “agent
         for (name), the carrier” or as “agent on behalf of (name), the carrier” or words
         of similar effect. When the carrier is identified elsewhere in the document as the
         “carrier”, the named agent may sign, for example, as “agent for [or on behalf of]
         the carrier” without naming the carrier again.

         for an actual date of shipment                    
                                                           
      H7) An air transport document is to indicate that the goods have been accepted for
         carriage or words of similar effect.              
      H8) a. An air transport document is to indicate a date of issuance. This date will be
           deemed to be the date of shipment unless an air transport document contains
           a specific notation of the actual date of shipment. In the latter event, the date
           stated in the notation will be deemed to be the date of shipment whether that
           date is before or after the issuance date of the air transport document.
         b. In the absence of a specific notation containing the actual date of shipment,
           any other information appearing on an air transport document relative to this
           information (including, for example, in a box labeled “For Carrier Use Only”,
           “Required Flight Date” or “Routing and Destination”) is to be disregarded in the
           determination of the date of shipment.          
         Airports of departure and destination             
      H9) An air transport document is to indicate the airport of departure and airport of
         destination stated in the credit. When a credit indicates either of these airports by
         also stating the country in which the airport is located, the name of the country
         need not be stated.                               
      H10) The airport of departure and airport of destination may also be indicated by the
         use of IATA codes instead of evidencing the airport name in full (for example, LAX
         instead of Los Angeles).                          
      H11) When a credit indicates a geographical area or range of airports of departure or
         destination (for example, “Any Chinese Airport” or “Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou
         airport”), an air transport document is to indicate the actual airport of departure
         or destination, which is to be within that geographical area or range of airports.
         An air transport document need not indicate the geographical area.
         Original of an air transport document             
      H12) An air transport document is to appear to be the original for consignor or shipper.
         When a credit requires a full set of originals, this is satisfied by the presentation of
         an air transport document indicating that it is the original for consignor or shipper.
         Consignee, order party and notify party           
      H13) a. When a credit requires an air transport document to evidence that goods
           are consigned “to order of (named entity)”, it may indicate that the goods are
           consigned to that entity, without mentioning “to order of”.
         b. When a credit requires an air transport document to evidence that goods
           are consigned “to order” without naming the entity to whose order the goods
           are to be consigned, it is to indicate that the goods are consigned to either
           the issuing bank or the applicant, without the need to mention the words
           “to order”.                                     
      H14) a. When a credit stipulates the details of one or more notify parties, an air
           transport document may also indicate the details of one or more additional
           notify parties.

         b. i. When a credit does not stipulate the details of a notify party, an air
             transport document may indicate the details of any notify party and in any
             manner (except as stated in paragraph H14) (b) (ii)).
           ii. When a credit does not stipulate the details of a notify party, but the
             details of the applicant appear as notify party on an air transport
             document, and these details include the applicant’s address and contact
             details, they are not to conflict with those stated in the credit.
      H15) When a credit requires an air transport document to evidence goods consigned
         to “issuing bank” or “applicant” or notify “applicant” or “issuing bank”, an air
         transport document is to indicate the name of the issuing bank or applicant, as
         applicable, but need not indicate their respective addresses or any contact details
         that may be stated in the credit.                 
      H16) When the address and contact details of the applicant appear as part of the
         consignee or notify party details, they are not to conflict with those stated in

         period when multiple air transport documents are presented
      H17) Transhipment is the unloading and reloading of goods from one aircraft to
         another during the carriage of those goods from the airport of departure to
         the airport of destination stated in the credit. When an air transport document
         does not indicate unloading and reloading between these two airports, it is not
         transhipment in the context of the credit and UCP 600 sub-articles 23 (b) and (c).
      H18) Dispatch on more than one aircraft is a partial shipment, even if each aircraft
         leaves on the same day for the same destination.  
      H19) a. When a credit prohibits partial shipment, and more than one air transport
           documents are presented covering dispatch from one or more airports of
           departure (as specifically allowed, or within a geographical area or range of
           airports stated in the credit), each air transport document is to indicate that
           it covers the dispatch of goods on the same aircraft and same flight and that
           the goods are destined for the same airport of destination.
         b. When a credit prohibits partial shipment, and more than one air transport
           documents are presented in accordance with paragraph H19) (a) and
           incorporate different dates of dispatch, the latest of these dates is to be used
           for the calculation of any presentation period and must fall on or before the
           latest shipment date stated in the credit.      
         c. When partial shipment is allowed, and more than one air transport documents
           are presented as part of a single presentation made under one covering
           schedule or letter and incorporate different dates of dispatch or different
           flights, the earliest of these dates is to be used for the calculation of any
           presentation period, and each of these dates must fall on or before the latest
           shipment date stated in the credit.

      H20) An air transport document is not to include a clause or clauses that expressly
         declare a defective condition of the goods or their packaging.
         For example:                                      
         a. A clause on an air transport document such as “packaging is not sufficient for
           the air journey” or words of similar effect is an example of a clause expressly
           declaring a defective condition of the packaging.
         b. A clause on an air transport document such as “packaging may not be
           sufficient for the air journey” or words of similar effect does not expressly
           declare a defective condition of the packaging. 
      H21) a. It is not necessary for the word “clean” to appear on an air transport document
           even when the credit requires an air transport document to be marked “clean”.
         b. Deletion of the word “clean” on an air transport document does not expressly
           declare a defective condition of the goods or their packaging.
         Goods description                                 
      H22) A goods description indicated on an air transport document may be in general
         terms not in conflict with the goods description in the credit.
         Corrections and alterations (“corrections”)       
                                                           
      H23) Any correction of data on an air transport document is to be authenticated. Such
         authentication is to appear to have been made by the carrier or any one of its
         named agents, who may be different from the agent that may have issued or
         signed the air transport document, provided they are identified as an agent of
         the carrier.                                      
      H24) Copies of an air transport document need not include authentication of any
         corrections that may have been made on the original.
         Freight and additional costs                      
      H25) A statement appearing on an air transport document indicating the payment of
         freight need not be identical to that stated in the credit, but is not to conflict with
         data in that document, any other stipulated document or the credit. For example,
         when a credit requires an air transport document to be marked “freight collect”, it
         may be marked “freight payable at destination”.   
      H26) An air transport document may contain separate boxes, which by their pre-printed
         headings indicate that they are for freight charges “prepaid” and for freight
         charges “collect”.                                
         a. When a credit requires an air transport document to show that freight has
           been prepaid, this will also be fulfilled by an indication of the freight charges
           under the heading “Freight Charges Prepaid” or words of similar effect.
         b. When a credit requires an air transport document to show that freight is to be
           collected or paid at destination, this will also be fulfilled by an indication of
           the freight charges under the heading “Freight Charges Collect” or words of
           similar effect.

      H27) a. When a credit states that costs additional to freight are not acceptable, an air
           transport document is not to indicate that costs additional to the freight have
           been or will be incurred.                       
         b. Reference in an air transport document to costs which may be levied, for
           example, as a result of a delay in unloading the goods or after the goods have
           been unloaded, is not an indication of costs additional to freight.

         Application of UCP 600 Article 24                 
      J1) A requirement in a credit for the presentation of a transport document covering
         movement of goods by either road or rail or inland waterway means that UCP 600
         article 24 is to be applied in the examination of that document.
         Carrier, identification of the carrier and signing of a road, rail or
         inland waterway transport document                
      J2) a. A road, rail or inland waterway transport document is to be signed in the form
           described in UCP 600 sub-article 24 (a) (i) and to indicate the name of the
           carrier, identified as the carrier (except as stated in paragraph J4) (b)).
         b. When a road, rail or inland waterway transport document is signed by a
           named branch of the carrier, the signature is considered to have been made
           by the carrier.                                 
         c. The term “carrier” includes terms such as “issuing carrier”, “actual carrier”,
           “succeeding carrier” and “contracting carrier”. 
      J3) Any signature, stamp or notation of receipt of the goods is to appear to indicate
         that it has been made by:                         
         a. the carrier, identified as the carrier; or     
         b. a named agent acting or signing for [or on behalf of] the carrier and
           indicating the name of the carrier, identified as the carrier, on whose behalf
           that agent is acting or signing; or             
         c. a railway company or railway station of departure.
      J4) a. The term “carrier” need not appear on the signature line provided the
           transport document appears to be signed by the carrier or a named agent for
           [or on behalf of] the carrier, and the carrier is otherwise identified elsewhere in
           the transport document as the “carrier”.        
         b. A rail transport document may bear a date stamp by the railway company or
           railway station of departure without indicating the name of the carrier or a
           named agent signing for [or on behalf of] the carrier.
         Place of shipment and place of destination        
      J5) A road, rail or inland waterway transport document is to indicate the place of
         shipment and place of destination stated in the credit. When a credit indicates
         either of these places by also stating the country in which the place is located, the
         name of the country need not be stated.

      J6) When a credit indicates a geographical area or range of places of shipment or
         destination (for example, “China” or “Shanghai, Beijing or Guangzhou”), a road,
         rail or inland waterway transport document is to indicate the actual place of
         shipment or destination, which is to be within that geographical area or range of
         places. A road, rail or inland waterway transport document need not indicate the
         geographical area.                                
         Original and duplicate of a road, rail or inland waterway
         transport document                                
                                                           
      J7) a. A rail or inland waterway transport document is to be considered as an
           original whether or not it is so marked.        
         b. A road transport document is to indicate that it is the original for consignor
           or shipper (copy for sender) or bear no marking indicating for whom the
           document has been prepared.                     
         c. Presentation of the original for consignor or shipper (copy for sender) of a road
           transport document or duplicate rail transport document shall suffice even
           when the credit requires presentation of a full set of the relevant transport
           documents.                                      
         d. A duplicate (often a carbon copy) of a rail transport document, authenticated
           by the signature or stamp of the railway company or the railway station of
           departure, is considered to be an original.     
         Consignee, order party and notify party           
      J8) a. When a credit requires a road or rail transport document to evidence that
           goods are consigned “to order of (named entity)”, it may indicate that the
           goods are consigned to that entity, without mentioning “to order of”.
         b. When a credit requires a road or rail transport document to evidence that
           goods are consigned “to order” without naming the entity to whose order
           the goods are to be consigned, it is to indicate that the goods are consigned
           either to the issuing bank or the applicant, without the need to mention the
           words “to order”.                               
         c. When a credit requires an inland waterway transport document, paragraphs
           J8) (a) and (b) will apply except when the document is issued in the form of a
           bill of lading. In such event, the consignee field is to be completed according
           to the requirements of the credit.              
      J9) a. When a credit stipulates the details of one or more notify parties, a road, rail
           or inland waterway transport document may also indicate the details of one
           or more additional notify parties.              
         b. i. When a credit does not stipulate the details of a notify party, a road, rail
             or inland waterway transport document may indicate the details of any
             notify party and in any manner (except as stated in paragraph J9) (b) (ii)).
           ii. When a credit does not stipulate the details of a notify party, but the
             details of the applicant appear as notify party on a road, rail or inland
             waterway transport document, and these details include the applicant’s
             address and contact details, they are not to conflict with those stated in
             the credit.

      J10) When a credit requires a road, rail or inland waterway transport document to
         evidence goods consigned to or to the order of “issuing bank” or “applicant” or
         notify “applicant” or “issuing bank”, a road, rail or inland waterway transport
         document is to indicate the name of the issuing bank or applicant, as applicable,
         but need not indicate their respective addresses or any contact details that may
         be stated in the credit. A road or rail transport document need not also indicate “to
         order of”, as stated in paragraph J8) (b).        
      J11) When the address and contact details of the applicant appear as part of the
         consignee or notify party details, they are not to conflict with those stated in
         the credit.                                       
         Transhipment, partial shipment and determining the presentation
         period when multiple road, rail or inland waterway transport
         documents are presented                           
      J12) Transhipment is the unloading and reloading of goods from one means of
         conveyance to another within the same mode of transport (truck [lorry], train,
         barge, etc.,) during the carriage of those goods from the place of shipment,
         dispatch or carriage to the place of destination stated in the credit. When a road,
         rail or inland waterway transport document does not indicate unloading and
         reloading between these two places, it is not transhipment in the context of the
         credit and UCP 600 sub-articles 24 (d) and (e).   
      J13) Shipment on more than one means of conveyance (more than one truck [lorry],
         train, barge, etc.,) is a partial shipment, even when such means of conveyance
         leaves on the same day for the same destination.  
      J14) a. When a credit prohibits partial shipment, and more than one road, rail or
           inland waterway transport documents are presented covering shipment
           from one or more places of shipment, dispatch or carriage (as specifically
           allowed, or within a geographical area or range of places stated in the credit),
           each road, rail or inland waterway transport document is to indicate that it
           covers the shipment, dispatch or carriage of goods on the same means of
           conveyance and same journey and that the goods are destined for the same
           place of destination.                           
         b. When a credit prohibits partial shipment, and more than one road, rail or
           inland waterway transport documents are presented in accordance with
           paragraph J14) (a) and incorporate different dates of shipment, the latest of
           these dates is to be used for the calculation of any presentation period, and
           must fall on or before the latest shipment date stated in the credit.
         c. When partial shipment is allowed, and more than one road, rail or inland
           waterway transport documents are presented as part of a single presentation
           made under one covering schedule or letter and incorporate different dates
           of shipment, on different means of conveyance or the same means of
           conveyance for a different journey, the earliest of these dates is to be used for
           the calculation of any presentation period and each of these dates must fall
           on or before the latest shipment date stated in the credit.

         Clean road, rail or inland waterway transport document
                                                           
      J15) A road, rail or inland waterway transport document is not to include a clause
         or clauses that expressly declare a defective condition of the goods or their
         packaging. For example:                           
         a. A clause on a road, rail or inland waterway transport document such as
           “packaging is not sufficient for the journey” or words of similar effect is
           an example of a clause expressly declaring a defective condition of the
           packaging.                                      
         b. A clause on a road, rail or inland waterway transport document such as
           “packaging may not be sufficient for the journey” or words of similar effect
           does not expressly declare a defective condition of the packaging.
      J16) a. It is not necessary for the word “clean” to appear on a road, rail or inland
           waterway transport document even when the credit requires a road, rail
           or inland waterway transport document to be marked “clean” or “clean on
           board”.                                         
         b. Deletion of the word “clean” on a road, rail or inland waterway transport
           document does not expressly declare a defective condition of the goods or
           their packaging.                                
         Goods description                                 
      J17) A goods description indicated on a road, rail or inland waterway transport
         document may be in general terms not in conflict with the goods description in
         the credit.                                       
         Corrections and alterations (“corrections”)       
      J18) Any correction of data on a road, rail or inland waterway transport document is
         to be authenticated. Such authentication is to appear to have been made by the
         carrier or any one of its named agents, who may be different from the agent that
         may have issued or signed the transport document, provided they are identified
         as an agent of the carrier.                       
      J19) Copies of a road, rail or inland waterway transport document need not include
         any authentication of any corrections that may have been made on the original.
         Freight and additional costs                      
      J20) a. A statement appearing on a road, rail or inland waterway transport document
           indicating the payment of freight need not be identical to that stated in the
           credit, but is not to conflict with data in that document, any other stipulated
           document or the credit. For example, when a credit requires a road, rail or
           inland waterway transport document to be marked “freight collect”, it may be
           marked “freight payable at destination”.        
         b. When a credit requires a road, rail or inland waterway transport document
           to indicate that freight has been prepaid or freight is to be collected at
           destination, this will also be fulfilled by the completion of boxes marked
           “Franco” (freight prepaid) or “Non-Franco” (freight to be collected).

      K1) A requirement in a credit for the presentation of an insurance document, such
         as an insurance policy, insurance certificate or declaration under an open
         cover, means that UCP 600 article 28 is to be applied in the examination of that
         document.                                         
         Issuer, signing and original of an insurance document
      K2) a. An insurance document is to appear to have been issued and signed by an
           insurance company or underwriter or their agent or proxy. For example, an
           insurance document issued and signed by “AA Insurance Ltd” appears to have
           been issued by an insurance company.            
         b. When an insurance document appears to have been signed by an agent or
           proxy, for or on behalf of the insurance company or underwriter, the name of
           the agent or proxy need not be stated.          
         c. When an issuer is identified as “insurer”, the insurance document need not
           indicate that it is an insurance company or underwriter.
      K3) An insurance document may also be issued on an insurance broker’s stationery,
         provided the insurance document has been signed by an insurance company or
         underwriter or their agent or proxy. An insurance broker may sign an insurance
         document as agent or proxy for [or on behalf of] a named insurance company or
         named underwriter.                                
      K4) An insurance document signed by an agent or proxy is to indicate the name of
         the insurance company or underwriter for [or on behalf of] which the agent or
         proxy is signing, unless the insurance company or underwriter name has been
         identified elsewhere in the document. For example, when “AA Insurance Ltd” has
         been identified as the insurer, the document may be signed “John Doe (by proxy)
         on behalf of the insurer” or “John Doe (by proxy) on behalf of AA Insurance Ltd”.
      K5) When an insurance document requires a countersignature by the issuer, the
         assured or a named entity, it must be countersigned.
      K6) An insurance document may show only the trading name of the insurance
         company in the signing field, provided it is identified as the insurance company
         elsewhere on the document, for example, when an insurance document is issued
         and signed “AA” in the signing field but shows “AA Insurance Ltd” and its address
         and contact information elsewhere in the document.

      International Standard Banking Practice for the Examination of Documents under UCP 600
                                                           
      K7) a. An insurance document that indicates that cover is provided by more than
           one insurer may be signed by a single agent or proxy on behalf of all insurers
           or be signed by an insurer for [or on behalf of] all co-insurers. An example
           of the latter will be when an insurance document is issued and signed “AA
           Insurance Ltd, leading insurer for [or on behalf of] the co-insurers”.
         b. Notwithstanding the provisions in paragraphs K2), K3) and K4), an insurance
           document which indicates that cover is provided by more than one
           insurer need not show the names of each insurer or the percentage of cover of
           each insurer.                                   
      K8) When a credit requires the insurance document to be issued in more than one
         original, or when the insurance document indicates that it has been issued in
         more than one original, all originals are to be presented and are to appear to have
         been signed.                                      
         Dates                                             
      K9) An insurance document is not to indicate an expiry date for the presentation of
         any claims thereunder.                            
      K10) a. An insurance document is not to indicate that cover is effective from a date
           later than the date of shipment.                
         b. When an insurance document indicates a date of issuance later than the date
           of shipment (as defined in UCP 600 articles 19-25), it is to clearly indicate by
           addition or note that coverage is effective from a date not later than the date
           of shipment.                                    
         c. An insurance document that indicates coverage has been effected from
           “warehouse-to-warehouse” or words of similar effect, and is dated after the
           date of shipment, does not indicate that coverage was effective from a date
           not later than the date of shipment.            
      K11) In the absence of any other date stated to be the issuance date or effective date
         of insurance coverage, a countersignature date will be deemed to be evidence of
         the effective date of the insurance coverage.     
         Amount of cover and percentage                    
      K12) When a credit does not indicate an amount to be insured, an insurance document
         is to be issued in the currency of and, as a minimum, for the amount indicated
         under UCP 600 sub-article 28 (f) (ii). There is no maximum percentage of insurance
         coverage.                                         
      K13) There is no requirement for insurance coverage to be calculated to more than two
         decimal places.                                   
      K14) An insurance document may indicate that cover is subject to a franchise or
         excess (deductible). However, when a credit requires the insurance cover to be
         irrespective of percentage, the insurance document is not to contain a clause
         stating that the insurance cover is subject to a franchise or an excess (deductible).
         An insurance document need not state “irrespective of percentage”.

      K15) When it is apparent from the credit or from the presentation that the amount
         demanded only represents a certain part of the gross value of the goods (for
         example, due to discounts, pre-payments or the like, or because part of the value
         of the goods is to be paid at a later date), the calculation of insurance cover is to
         be based on the full gross value of the goods as shown on the invoice or the credit
         and subject to the requirements of UCP 600 sub-article 28 (f) (ii).
      K16) Insurance covering the same risk for the same shipment is to be covered under
         one document unless more than one insurance document is presented indicating
         partial cover, and each document clearly reflects, by percentage or otherwise:
         a. the value of each insurer’s cover;             
         b. that each insurer will bear its share of the liability severally and without pre-
           conditions relating to any other insurance cover that may have been effected
           for that shipment; and                          
         c. the respective coverage of the documents, when totalled, equals at least the
           insured amount required by the credit or UCP 600 sub-article 28 (f) (ii).
         Risks to be covered                               
      K17) a. An insurance document is to cover the risks required by the credit.
         b. Even though a credit may be explicit with regard to risks to be covered, there
           may be a reference to exclusion clauses in the insurance document.
                                                           
      K18) When a credit requires “all risks” coverage, this is satisfied by the presentation of
         an insurance document evidencing any “all risks” clause or notation, whether or
         not it bears the heading “all risks”, even when it is indicated that certain risks are
         excluded. An insurance document indicating that it covers Institute Cargo Clauses
         (A) or Institute Cargo Clauses (Air), when dispatch is effected by air satisfies a
         condition in a credit calling for an “all risks” clause or notation.
         Insured party and endorsement                     
      K19) An insurance document is to be in the form required by the credit and, where
         necessary, be endorsed by the entity to whose order or in whose favour claims
         are payable.                                      
      K20) a. A credit should not require an insurance document to be issued “to bearer”, or
           “to order”. A credit should indicate the name of an insured party.
         b. When a credit requires an insurance document to be issued ”to order of
           (named entity)” the document need not indicate “to order” provided that the
           named entity is shown as the insured party or claims are payable to it, and
           assignment by endorsement is not expressly prohibited.
      K21) a. When a credit is silent as to the insured party, an insurance document is
           not to evidence that claims are payable to the order of, or in favour of, the
           beneficiary or any entity other than the issuing bank or applicant, unless it is
           endorsed by the beneficiary or that entity in blank or in favour of the issuing
           bank or applicant.                              
         b. An insurance document is to be issued or endorsed so that the right to receive
           payment under it passes upon, or prior to, the release of the documents.

         Insurance premium                                 
      K23) Any indication on an insurance document regarding payment of an insurance
         premium is to be disregarded unless the insurance document indicates that it is
         not valid unless the premium has been paid and there is an indication that the
         premium has not been paid.

      L1) When a credit requires the presentation of a certificate of origin, this will be
         satisfied by the presentation of a signed document that appears to relate to the
         invoiced goods and certifies their origin.        
      L2) When a credit requires the presentation of a specific form of certificate of origin
         such as a GSP Form A, only a document in that specific form is to be presented.
         Issuer of a certificate of origin                 
      L3) a. A certificate of origin is to be issued by the entity stated in the credit.
         b. When a credit does not indicate the name of an issuer, any entity may issue a
           certificate of origin.                          
         c. i. When a credit requires the presentation of a certificate of origin issued
             by the beneficiary, the exporter or the manufacturer, this condition will
             also be satisfied by the presentation of a certificate of origin issued by a
             Chamber of Commerce or the like, such as, but not limited to, Chamber of
             Industry, Association of Industry, Economic Chamber, Customs Authorities
             and Department of Trade or the like, provided it indicates the beneficiary,
             the exporter or the manufacturer as the case may be.
           ii. When a credit requires the presentation of a certificate of origin issued
             by a Chamber of Commerce, this condition will also be satisfied by the
             presentation of a certificate of origin issued by a Chamber of Industry,
             Association of Industry, Economic Chamber, Customs Authorities and
             Department of Trade or the like.              
         Content of a certificate of origin                
      L4) A certificate of origin is to appear to relate to the invoiced goods, for example, by:
         a. a goods description that corresponds to that in the credit or a description
           shown in general terms not in conflict with the goods description in the credit;
           or                                              
         b. referring to a goods description appearing in another stipulated document
           or in a document that is attached to, and forming an integral part of, the
           certificate of origin.                          
      L5) Consignee information, when shown, is not to conflict with the consignee
         information in the transport document. However, when a credit requires a
         transport document to be issued “to order”, “to the order of shipper”, “to order of
         issuing bank”, “to order of nominated bank (or negotiating bank)” or “consigned to
         issuing bank”, a certificate of origin may show the consignee as any entity named
         in the credit except the beneficiary. When a credit has been transferred, the first
         beneficiary may be stated to be the consignee.

      L6) A certificate of origin may indicate as the consignor or exporter an entity other
         than the beneficiary of the credit or the shipper as shown on any other stipulated
         document.                                         
      L7) When a credit indicates the origin of the goods without stipulating a requirement
         for the presentation of a certificate of origin, any reference to the origin on a
         stipulated document is not to conflict with the stated origin. For example, when a
         credit indicates “origin of the goods: Germany” without requiring the presentation
         of a certificate of origin, a statement on any stipulated document indicating a
         different origin of the goods is to be considered a conflict of data.
      L8) A certificate of origin may indicate a different invoice number, invoice date and

      Q7) When a credit indicates specific requirements with respect to analysis, inspection,
         health, phytosanitary, quantity or quality assessment or the like, with or without
         stipulating the document to indicate compliance with these requirements, the
         data regarding the analysis, inspection, health, phytosanitary, quantity or quality
         assessment or the like mentioned on the certificate or any other stipulated
         document are not to conflict with those requirements.

         including, but not limited to, any required standard for determining the results
         of the analysis, inspection or quality assessment, the certificate may include
         statements such as “not fit for human consumption”, “chemical composition may
         not meet required needs” or words of similar effect, provided such statements do
         not conflict with the credit, any other stipulated document or UCP 600.
      Q9) Consignee information, when shown, is not to conflict with the consignee
         information in the transport document. However, when a credit requires a
         transport document to be issued “to order”, “to the order of shipper”, “to order of
         issuing bank”, “to order of nominated bank (or negotiating bank)” or “consigned
         to issuing bank”, a certificate may show the consignee as any entity named in
         the credit except the beneficiary. When a credit has been transferred, the first
         beneficiary may be stated to be the consignee.    
      Q10) A certificate may indicate as the consignor or exporter an entity other than
         the beneficiary of the credit or the shipper as shown on any other stipulated
         document.                                         
      Q11) A certificate may indicate a different invoice number, invoice date and shipment
         routing to that indicated on one or more other stipulated documents, provided the
         exporter or consignor shown on the certificate is not the beneficiary.

                  Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (UCP) is a
                  set of rules on the issuance and use of letters of credit. For more
                  than 85 years, the UCP have governed letter of credit
                  transactions worldwide. The rules now also include version 2.0 of
                  the eUCP—the 14 articles of ICC’s supplement to the UCP that
                  govern presentation of documents in electronic form.

                  objectives in international business.

                  International Standby Practices is a new set of rules and best
                  practice for users of standby letters of credit. Though standby
                  letters of credit have similarities with commercial letters of credit
                  and other financial instrument, there are significant differences in
                  scope and practice. A new set of Rules was therefore required for
                  this workhorse of commerce and finance and ISP 98 fills this
                  important gap in the market place.

                  The International Standard Demand Guarantee Practice for URDG
                  758 (ISDGP) is the indispensable companion to the ICC Uniform
                  Rules for Demand Guarantees 758 (URDG). It represents
                  international best practice in demand guarantees. It supplements,
                  but does not amend, the URDG. The 215 international standard
                  practices in this publication have been collected through a
                  decade of the application of the URDG. They record best practice
                  in demand guarantees throughout the lifecycle of the guarantee:
                  the drafting and issue of guarantees and counter-guarantees,
                  presentations, examinations and payments, rejections and expiry,
                  transfers and assignments, and more.

                  The value of the forfaiting market is estimated at more than US$
                  300 billion annually. The use of global rules and standards helps
                  avoid misunderstandings, harmonizes best practice around the
                  globe and facilitates dispute settlement. For the first time, ICC’s
                  URF now provide a standard set of forfaiting rules that reflect a
                  broad consensus among bankers, users and all members of the
                  forfaiting community worldwide.

      Since its initial publication in 2002 (Publication 645), International
      Standard Banking Proctice (ISBP) has become an invaluable aid to trade
      finance professionals when creating documents for presentation under,
      or for the examination of documents presented under, a documentary
      credit. lt comprises a compilation of banking practices that are to be
      applied when working with documentary credits that are subject to
      UCP 600. ISBP demonstrates how the principles and content of UCP
      600 should be integrated into day-to-day practice by providing readers
      with detailed practices that are to be considered and applied when
      working with different trade documents (invoices, transport documents,
      insurance documents, certificates of origin. .. ). ISBP also provides
      coverage of documents which are not specifically mentioned in UCP.
